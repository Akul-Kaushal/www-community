This is especially relevant for those who are standing up an Application Security Program from greenfield. You will walk away from this talk with a deeper understanding of leadership principles that can only be learned in the battle arena of AppSec leadership. No theory, no untested ideas, just hard lessons learned from a beginner leader that are relevant no matter how much experience you have.\n\nSpecial thanks to the Rule4 Team for hosting and sponsoring, we couldn't do these events without our sponsors.

The first sessions will focus on Windows but later sessions will cover 7.x on Linux.\n\nSince 5.1 is the default on Windows servers, we will start there. The primary IDE will be VS Code as it is the officially supported current PowerShell editor. Since you can't normally install it on production servers, though, running and debugging scripts in it will also be covered as it overcomes the \"it works on my system\" issue."

Misaligned incentives, late-stage scans, and noisy alerts lead to friction and slow remediation. This talk explores how shifting security earlier in the SDLC and aligning with developer workflows can improve outcomes across the board.\nYou'll learn how developer empowerment, real-time feedback, and actionable guidance reduce alert fatigue, shorten MTTR, and drive better collaboration between teams.\n\n**Thanks to our SPONSOR**: *[Arnica](https://www.arnica.io/)*\n*Pipelineless AppSec. Developer-Native Workflows.*\n*Surface the right risk to the right owner at the right time with pipelineless, developer-native workflows that foster collaboration, increase development velocity, and reduce overall risk.*\n\n**SPONSORSHIP Opportunities Available**\n*Vendors interested in sponsoring please send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

His background spans over 30 years in the software industry and 20 years of that focused in the security space. Mic\u2019s background in security spans across multiple disciplines including SAST and DAST in the application security space, network security leveraging anomaly based detection, data level security leveraging digital rights management, mobile security leveraging proactive attack detection and most recently developer focused security enabling organizations to scale and address modern cloud native application security concerns. This diverse background has given him an appreciation for the multitude of risks and competing priorities facing organizations today.\n\n**Abstract**:\nDeep Application Inspection - a very specific type of runtime, a nonintrusive, lightweight way to observe applications in realtime to observe realtime behavior and attacks as well as provide mitigating controls inside the app. If you\u2019re tired of proactively spending countless hours trying to find and fix issues before an application is released just to find out the majority of the issues you focused on posed no real security risk or after the application is deployed, waiting for a successful exploitation by an attacker to trigger some reactive scramble to seeing what happened, join us to learn about a new technology providing a layer of visibility not previously available.\n\n**Location**:\nGuidePoint Security\n3030 N Rocky Point Dr W\nSTE 600\nTampa, FL 33607\n\n**Sponsors**:\noligo security \\| [oligosecurity.io](https://oligosecurity.io)"
