We will talk about how fuzzing can be used to detect program errors unrelated to project requirements. The main focus will be fuzzing functions, with known source code, that receive input from untrusted sources.\n\n20:00 \u2013 20:30 Networking break\n\n20:30 \u2013 21:25 \"Secure SDLC with a DevOps Flavor!\" by Jim Manico\nPlease note, that Jim will join us over Teams.\nJoin Jim Manico for an enlightening session on \"Secure SDLC with a DevOps Flavor!\" where he merges cutting-edge DevOps practices with robust security measures. In this talk, Jim will delve into automating security within the CI/CD pipeline to ensure continuous security integration, advocate for a shift-left approach to catch vulnerabilities early, and discuss implementing Security as Code to maintain consistent security configurations. He will also emphasize the importance of fostering a DevSecOps culture where security is a shared responsibility across all teams. Additionally, Jim will outline essential tools and technologies that enhance security in DevOps environments, and stress the significance of monitoring security metrics for continuous improvement. This session is a must-attend for professionals seeking to integrate effective security practices into their development cycles without sacrificing speed or efficiency."

Additionally, it will cover important outputs (like VEX and VDR statements) that efficient vulnerability management programs can use to communicate outcomes and posture to internal and external audiences.\n\nEvent sponsored by FOSSA: https://fossa.com/\nDinner provided\nPlease arrive on-time as we begin promptly at 5:30."

As mobile apps become increasingly vital to both personal and business activities, ensuring their security is essential to protect sensitive data, maintain user privacy, and build trust. With the rapid growth of mobile usage, attackers are constantly finding new ways to exploit vulnerabilities in mobile applications.\nIn this session, we will delve into some of the most common and emerging methods used to attack mobile applications, including:\n\u2022 Repackaging apps: Modifying legitimate apps to include malicious code and redistributing them.\n\u2022 Hooking frameworks: Using tools to intercept and manipulate app behavior for malicious purposes.\n\u2022 Mobile bots: Leveraging automated scripts to perform various malicious activities such as credential stuffing and spamming.\n\u2022 Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks: Intercepting communication between the app and the server to steal data or inject malicious content.\nBy understanding these threats and learning about best practices for mobile app security, you can better protect your applications and users from potential attacks.\nJoin us for this interactive session to gain valuable insights and practical knowledge on securing mobile apps effectively!\n\nSpeaker : Shahnawaz Backer / Senior Solutions Architect, Asia Pacific, China and Japan\n\nShort Bio :\nShahn Backer is an ever inquisitive cyber security professional, who is intrigued by modern applications and its challenges. He has a keen interest in modern application security, digital identity, multi-cloud security and edge compute. He is currently a Senior Solutions Architects and focusses on application agility and security .\n\nHe frequently writes on IT security at f5labs.com and has co-authored a Redbook on access management deployment patterns.

        "description": "G'day all,\n\nIt was great to see new faces last month. Thank you to those that attended.\n\nIn our last meetup, attendees voted for [Spicy Korea](https://g.co/kgs/FnXwKAr) as our location this month. On 28th August 2024 6PM, there we shall meet.\n\n*There's NO BOOKING. If you're the first to arrive, please grab a table for the group and post a picture of the table's location in the comments of this meetup event. We'll use it to locate each other. (If you don't see a post, you're lucky first. Please grab us a table and post a pic. )*\n\n**Please remember to update your RSVP if you can no longer attend.** Even if it's just 30 minutes prior. It'll help whomever that arrives first know how big a table to get.\n\nWe're looking forward to the discussions we had once again.\n\nSee you there.\n\nMore details on the format, and what to expect below:\n\n**The Practitioner's Roundtable**\nIt's a monthly meetup, for AppSec/ProdSec practitioners to participate discussing AppSec/ProdSec topics and share knowledge. There's no speakers, or sponsors; just a facilitator, with the expectation that you'll join the conversations. Broadly, the idea is that you're swinging by after work, for a regular catch-up with our peers over dinner (with F&B at your own cost) with a known format.\n\\-\\-\\-\n**So, what's happening?**\nThe format:\n\n1. At 6pm all attendees arrive, and order (and pay for) their own meals - we'll do the rest while waiting for the meals to arrive and as we eat.\n2. All attendees write down on a card 1-2 AppSec/ProdSec related topics they'd like to discuss.\n3. We'll all each cast 3 votes on the cards we'd like to discuss.\n4. We'll sort the cards, and discuss the topics with the top 3-4 highest votes. Starting with the topic with the highest votes.\n5. After 5(?) minutes, we all decide if we'd like to continue or move on to the next topic.\n6. If we continue, after 15(?) minutes, we all move on to the next topic of discussion.\n7. At 7pm, we wrap up and officially end. Before everyone leaves, we vote on the next restaurant that we'll meet at.\n\nThis is[ inspired by Lean Coffee](https://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/), and intended for participants to be collaborators in the conversation focused on AppSec & ProdSec topics.\nFor the location selection, here are the considerations we work with:\n\n1. It must be within 1 \"city block\" of the Melbourne Free Tram Zone.\n2. The typical price for a whole meal (without alcohol) should be under $50 per person.\n3. It must allow individual orders - you'd be ordering and paying for your own meal.\n4. It will need to have seating space for the group to say, just walk-in to the restaurant ( this may change if it grows beyond 10 regular attendees ).\n5. It must be quiet enough for us to have meaningful conversations.\n6. It must not be a restaurant we've been to in the past 6 months. (Just to keep things fresh )\n\nAlso, although we use the word \u201crestaurant\u201d this is used broadly to mean food establishment - if we\u2019re all keen on hitting up a decent kebab place, that works. As a courtesy to the venue, there's an expectation that you'd order something there.\n\nSee you there.\nThank you."
