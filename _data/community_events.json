The risk elements in software supply chains are different from those assessed during vendor risk management efforts and are constantly evolving. For example, studies have shown that the average commercial application has hundreds of component suppliers \u2013 each with their own release criteria, coding standards, and risk management.\nRegulated industries and global legislative efforts to learn how risk informed software supply chain management can function without disrupting development velocity. SBOMs are a core component of software risk management, but it\u2019s only one element. Attestations, threat models, and continuous threat monitoring transform a simple SBOM into a pillar of a modern cyber risk management program."

        "description": "**TOPIC**: Breaking Through CVE Noise: Analyzing 5 Key Prioritization Inputs\nJoin us for great networking, dinner and drinks, and see a presentation by **Chelsea Boling**, a Customer Success Architect at **FOSSA**\n\n**ABSTRACT**: Thousands of new Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) are reported each year, which puts a massive burden on security teams to prioritize and address the most critical threats effectively. This is especially true since most vulnerabilities aren\u2019t actually exploitable in their real-world context, and wasting time on non-exploitable issues can get in the way of remediating the most impactful vulnerabilities.\nThis talk will explore strategies to mitigate CVE overload and streamline the vulnerability resolution process. In addition to exploring complexities around CVE noise \u2014 such as the difficulty in distinguishing between high-risk, low-risk, and no-risk vulnerabilities and the pressure to maintain business continuity while ensuring robust security \u2014 we\u2019ll analyze five specific vulnerability prioritization inputs:\n\n1. CVSS scores\n2. EPSS scores\n3. VEX\n4. The CISA KEV Catalog\n5. Reachability analysis\n\nAdditionally, the talk will cover the role of automation and tooling to prioritize vulnerabilities at scale as well as recommended workflows between IT, security teams, and business units to ensure comprehensive risk management.\n\n**Thanks to our SPONSOR**: *[FOSSA](https://fossa.com/)*\n*FOSSA is a leading application security and compliance platform that specializes in helping engineering teams deliver trusted software. FOSSA enables companies to prioritize real vulnerabilities in their open source dependencies with comprehensive SCA (software composition analysis) capabilities, while also making it possible for organizations to automate compliance reporting and SBOM (software bill of materials) lifecycle management to meet customer and regulatory requirements. Founded in 2015, FOSSA is trusted by thousands of global organizations, has been downloaded nearly two million times, and has conducted nearly 100 million open-source scans.*\n\n**Thanks to our HOST**: *[HiveWatch](https://www.hivewatch.com/)*\n*Intelligent, efficient, and scalable security*\n*HiveWatch is a cloud-based SaaS platform built for physical security teams to enhance their current security technologies. It streamlines incident response, allows for the consolidation of disparate programs and systems, and reduces false alarms.*\n\n**SPONSORSHIP Opportunities Available**\n*Vendors interested in sponsoring please send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

        "description": "G'day all,\n\nWe had a great meetup last month. Thank you to those that attended.\nTo make it easier, let's call this new format \"Practitioner's Roundtable\". We'll keep this going for the rest of this year. Following the survey last month of when you'd like to have these meetings, 66.7% of you told us you'd prefer the last Wednesday of the month - so, it shall be.\n\nIn our last meetup, attendees voted for [Dr. Watson's Bar in the CBD](https://www.thesherlockholmes.com.au/dr-watsons-bar/) as our location this month. On 31st July 2024 6PM, there we shall meet.\n\n*There's NO BOOKING. If you're the first to arrive, please grab a table for the group and post a picture of the table's location in the comments of this meetup event. We'll use it to locate each other. (If you don't see a post, you're lucky first. Please grab us a table and post a pic.* \\*)\\*\n\nPlease remember to update your RSVP if you can no longer attend. Even if it's just 30 minutes prior. It'll help whomever that arrives first know how big a table to get.\n\nWe're looking forward to the discussions we had once again.\nSee you there.\n\nMore details on the format, and what to expect below:\n\n**The Practitioner's Roundtable**\nIt's a monthly meetup, for AppSec/ProdSec practitioners to participate discussing AppSec/ProdSec topics and share knowledge. There's no speakers, or sponsors; just a facilitator, with the expectation that you'll join the conversations. Broadly, the idea is that you're swinging by after work, for a regular catch-up with our peers over dinner (with F&B at your own cost) with a known format.\n\\-\\-\\-\n**So, what's happening?**\nThe format:\n\n1. At 6pm all attendees arrive, and order (and pay for) their own meals - we'll do the rest while waiting for the meals to arrive and as we eat.\n2. All attendees write down on a card 1-2 AppSec/ProdSec related topics they'd like to discuss.\n3. We'll all each cast 3 votes on the cards we'd like to discuss.\n4. We'll sort the cards, and discuss the topics with the top 3-4 highest votes. Starting with the topic with the highest votes.\n5. After 5(?) minutes, we all decide if we'd like to continue or move on to the next topic.\n6. If we continue, after 15(?) minutes, we all move on to the next topic of discussion.\n7. At 7pm, we wrap up and officially end. Before everyone leaves, we vote on the next restaurant that we'll meet at.\n\nThis is [inspired by Lean Coffee](https://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/), and intended for participants to be collaborators in the conversation focused on AppSec & ProdSec topics.\nFor the location selection, here are the considerations we work with:\n\n1. It must be within 1 \"city block\" of the Melbourne Free Tram Zone.\n2. The typical price for a whole meal (without alcohol) should be under $50 per person.\n3. It must allow individual orders - you'd be ordering and paying for your own meal.\n4. It will need to have seating space for the group to say, just walk-in to the restaurant ( this may change if it grows beyond 10 regular attendees ).\n5. It must be quiet enough for us to have meaningful conversations.\n6. It must not be a restaurant we've been to in the past 6 months. (Just to keep things fresh )\n\nAlso, although we use the word \u201crestaurant\u201d this is used broadly to mean food establishment - if we\u2019re all keen on hitting up a decent kebab place, that works. As a courtesy to the venue, there's an expectation that you'd order something there.\n\nSee you there.\nThank you."

Is it the OWASP Top Ten, formal guidelines established by organizations such as NIST, security stories developed by the product owner and the security team, or recommendations made by your development team? The answer is all the above depending on the client, your development environment, and your capacity to take the risk.\n\nThis presentation will share experiences gained from penetration testing of a web application hosted by a Government agency providing professional licenses to its prospective clients. The nature of the project touched numerous areas such as CJIS (Criminal Justice Information Service), Personal Identifiable Information (PII), Access Control (Authorization in particular), and adherence to the security standard\u2019s office guidelines. The challenge was to identify and prioritize the test suite that will cover these specific areas in a constrained time period. To enhance the coverage, the test suite had to include DAST (using ZAP) and some specific general scenarios.\n\nThe audience will take away some approaches that when applied can lead to a well balanced (both effective and efficient) penetration testing.\n\nSCHEDULE\nDoors open at 5:30. The talk will begin about 6pm.\n\nENTRY\nThere are doors on Washington and Broadway. Both of them auto-lock at 6pm. From 6 to 6:15pm, only the door on Broadway will be available.
