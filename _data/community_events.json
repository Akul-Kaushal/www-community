And yes, there will be **delicious food and drinks** generously provided by our sponsors!\n\n5:00 PM : Doors open, Networking, food and drinks\n5.30 PM :- Chapter introductions\n5.45-6.15 PM :- Beyond Shift-Left: The Rise of Application Detection and Response (ADR) and the Lessons Learned from RASP\n6.15-7.00 PM :- Android app security - with a dash of LLM\n7.0-7.45 PM :- LLM multi-agent system integrity, threat modeling\n\n**Talk #1** Beyond Shift-Left: The Rise of Application Detection and Response (ADR) and the Lessons Learned from RASP\n\n**Description:** Last year, we explored the challenges of shifting security left\u2014highlighting how pushing security responsibilities onto developers often leads to alert fatigue, noise, and time spent chasing \"theoretical risk.\" This year, we pick up the conversation by examining another major trend in application security: the rise and fall of Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) and how it has paved the way for a new category\u2014Application Detection and Response (ADR).\nRASP was introduced with high hopes: the promise of protecting applications from within, in real time. In theory, it was a game-changer. But in practice, many organizations struggled with the reality\u2014RASP tools are difficult to scale, introduce friction, and most critically, had the power to crash the very applications they were meant to protect.\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll explore:\nThe promise of RASP and why it often fails to deliver on its potentialReal-world challenges teams faced when deploying and maintaining RASP solutions\u2014including stability concerns, performance tradeoffs, and operational complexityHow these challenges led to the emergence of Application Detection and Response (ADR) as a more practical, scalable approach to real-time application securityThe core principles of ADR, how it differs from RASP, and why it represents a critical evolution in the application security landscapeLessons learned from early adopters of ADR: what\u2019s working, what\u2019s not, and what\u2019s next\nAttendees will leave with a clearer understanding of:\nThe limits of \"shift-left\" and why real-time protection mattersThe hard-earned lessons from RASP deploymentsHow ADR builds on the vision of RASP while addressing its key shortcomingsPractical insights for integrating ADR into your security strategy without disrupting developer workflows or application stability\nThis talk is ideal for application security practitioners, developers, and technical leaders who want to move beyond theory to practical, actionable strategies for securing modern applications in production.\n\n**Speaker:** **Katie Pistello**, is a Sr. Solutions Engineer at Oligo Security, where she helps organizations navigate the evolving landscape of application security with a focus on real-time detection and runtime context.\nBefore joining Oligo, Katie worked at Snyk where she partnered with engineering and security teams to operationalize developer-first security tooling and scale modern application security programs. Her background positions her to help enterprises take their security programs beyond checkbox compliance and into scalable, actionable practices that reduce real risk.\n\n**Talk#2** Android app security - with a dash of LLM.\n\n**Abstract -** Over 3 billion android devices in use worldwide. The threat landscape increases as more and more devices use the Android platform and it becomes crucial to learn Android app security.\nIn this talk, we will start with some Android basics and key security concepts. After that, we will discuss a hybrid approach where we combine Classic Static analysis with LLMs contextual understanding of the code semantics to go beyond just discovering exported components in Android apps.\nWe will also demonstrate an open source LLM tool that assists in the deobfuscation of Android bytecode and may help in finding vulnerabilities.\n\n**Speaker :-** Vaibhav Agrawal Security Engineer at Google\nA cybersecurity professional with over a decade of experience in safeguarding digital assets, with core expertise in **Application Security**, **Mobile Security**, and **LLM Security**. His skill set spans a broad range of security and privacy domains, developed through both academic and industry experience, including **Infrastructure Security**, **Cloud Security**, and **Windows Active Directory Security**.\nVaibav is **IEEE Senior Member**, a **security conference speaker**, and an active **contributor to open-source projects**.

Leveraging blockchain\u2019s secure architecture, the framework involves specialized LLM Agents\u2014ContractMining, Investigative, Ethics, and PerformanceMonitor, coordinated by a ManagerAgent. Baseline LLM models achieved 30% accuracy with a threshold method and 94% accuracy with a random-forest method. The Claude 3.5-powered LLM system reached an accuracy of 92%. Ethical evaluations revealed biases, highlighting the need for fairness-focused refinements. Our approach aims to develop trustworthy and reliable networks of agents capable of functioning even in adversarial environments. To our knowledge, no existing systems employ ethical LLM agents specifically designed to detect fraud, making this a novel contribution. Future work will focus on refining ethical frameworks, scaling the system, and benchmarking it against traditional methods to establish a robust, adaptable, and ethically grounded solution for blockchain fraud detection.\n\n**Speaker:-** Ying-Jung Chen, PhD\nYing-Jung is a machine learning engineer, launching her career in the greater Seattle area.

In this talk, we'll walk through the journey of identifying, locating, and analyzing parking controllers using DIY tools and techniques.\n\nWe'll explore a classic Bluetooth and BLE highlighting how accessible methods can uncover vulnerabilities in seemingly innocuous infrastructure. The goal isn't just to break things but to understand them and show how anyone with a soldering iron, a few scripts and a lot of persistence can demystify some systems.\n\nThis session will give you practical insights, real-world examples and a few laughs along the way.\n\n**About the Speaker**\nDavid Sopas is an experienced security researcher with a wide range of expertise. As COO of Char49, he has played a key role in driving the company\u2019s success. David is also a sought-after speaker, having presented at numerous conferences including Def Con, BSides, and RSA, sharing his ideas and knowledge with audiences around the world. His exceptional work includes being the creator of MindAPI - an open-source API security methodology, which has gained recognition within the industry.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\n**Aged Like a Fine Port: Old Yet Impactful**\nby Paulo A. Silva, Principal Security Researcher @ Char49\n\nIn this talk, we will delve into a critical XML Signature Wrapping (XSW) vulnerability (CVE-2023-34923) in a service management platform that remained undetected for over a decade despite regular penetration testing. The vulnerability was found in a Microsoft Azure AD integration, which many assumed to be \"safe by default\" due to the software giant's reputation for adhering to security best practices. However, the responsibility for validating the SAML response remained with the receiving party, and this crucial step had been overlooked. This session will explore the technical details, possible human factors behind the oversight, and the broader lessons for the security community.\n\nThis session will provide a comprehensive look at how seemingly minor assumptions can lead to long-term security blind spots. While XML Signature Wrapping is a well-known and well-documented vulnerability, this illustrates how even established weaknesses can persist when certain assumptions go unchallenged. Attendees will learn about the technical mechanisms of the vulnerability, the psychological factors that might have contributed to its prolonged existence, and practical strategies for identifying similar weaknesses in their own systems. The talk will emphasize the importance of questioning assumptions, thoroughly validating third-party integrations, and giving proper attention to complex, resource-intensive features.\n\nJoin this talk to gain insights into the technical specifics of XML Signature Wrapping and its exploitation, the psychological and operational biases that might have kept it hidden for so long, and practical recommendations to avoid similar pitfalls in your own environments.\n\n**About the Speaker**\nPaulo is a security practitioner with a solid background in software development, who has spent the last decade focused on identifying critical vulnerabilities and breaking software. He is a long-time OWASP volunteer and co-leader of the OWASP API Security Project, where he advocates for secure API practices and contributes significantly to mitigating security risks in the API landscape."

Join us for networking with your peers and a featured talk from Ryan Boyle presenting:\n\nThe OWASP Access Log Parser Project\n\nGenerating log files is a critical first step in defending a web application, but they don't do you much good unless someone actually looks at them. The OWASP Access Log Parser Project is an effort to simplify that process by converting terse and sometimes encoded log files into a format that can more easily be read by people, and more importantly, fed to automated monitoring tools. It also includes the ability to do analysis directly by comparing requests to a library of known attacks.\n\nJoin us as the project's Lead Developer, Ryan Boyle, guides us through the goals, features, and future direction of the project. For more details on the project, check out the OWASP Page: https://owasp.org/www-project-access-log-parser/\n\nSpecial thanks to the Rule4 Team for hosting and sponsoring, we couldn't do these events without our sponsors.

If you are thinking \"Wait, what does that have to do with application security, Bill?\" the answer is ... everything.\n\nThis talk outlines several challenges inherent to the biomanufacturing industry, such as the poorly understood and highly dynamic nature of biomanufacturing processes. Instruments critical to assessing quality and safety are described as among the least defensible apparatus humanity has ever built, leaving the sector exposed to adversarial threats. Despite recent progress in bioengineering, the explainability of these manufacturing processes is still built on fragile foundations.\n\nTo address these issues, Peter suggests moving away from flawed traditional methods of assessment and adopting physics-based probabilistic models, which offer better assurance and explainability. he emphasizes the importance of formal methods to ensure reliability and manage risks without completely rebuilding the system. Additionally, he advocates for accepting manageable risks and enhancing manufacturing trust through practical, science-based solutions."

Has that helped? What has been going on in the world of supply chain security.In this talk we will explore the Supply chain security not just from a code base dependency prospective but rather wholistic approach to establishing the right controls in the system for a seamless software delivery.Software supply chain security concerns not just the product organizations creating software of external or internal usage but also for organizations that may be just using the final product as an end user.From your development environment to production, from downloading binaries from internet to running them on network machines we will explore the 360 degree view of supply chain security, the relevant case studies around the exploitation and what is it that industry or Govt bodies have done towards protecting people or organizations against such attacks.Audience will leave with a holistic view of how the full supply chain of the software development looks like and thoughts on what are the possible gaps in security they might have in their organizations.\n\n**AI Second \u2013 Threat Centric Agentic approach on Vulnerabilities**\n**\\- Because terrible data in \\-\\> terrible data out \u2013 just prettier**\n\nThe application of AI agents in cybersecurity has evolved beyond simple automation tools, becoming powerful systems capable of understanding complex contexts and deriving actionable insights. This talk explores the use of AI agents, specifically retrained models in collaboration with tools like Google Gemini, to accurately identify threats, assess their impact, and determine threat actor involvement.\nCybersecurity teams face the challenge of managing disparate security domains\u2014application security vulnerabilities often exist separately from infrastructure security concerns. This division often leads to fragmented efforts, where one team focuses on threat actor profiling using frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK, while another addresses development processes through appsec best practices. CISOs, in particular, struggle to reconcile these differences into cohesive metrics and strategies.\nAs organizations adopt cloud environments and containerization, a new divide emerges between development teams and security operations. Both groups play critical roles in the overall cybersecurity posture but often fail to collaborate effectively. The friction stems from the lack of a unified view that integrates threat intelligence, vulnerability management, and application security.\nThis session proposes an integrated, threat-centric approach that unifies these domains through the application of AI agents. By using real-world, context-aware agents to analyze threats, we can customize models to detect vulnerabilities with high accuracy, determine the likelihood of exploitation, and assess the potential impact. These agents are retrained to continuously adapt and improve their understanding of threat landscapes, including sophisticated threats like ransomware.\n\n**SPEAKERS**\n\n**Anant Shrivastava** is a highly experienced information security professional with over 15 years of corporate experience. He is a frequent speaker and trainer at international conferences, and is the founder of Cyfinoid Research, a cyber security research firm. He leads open source projects such as Tamer Platform and CodeVigilant, and is actively involved in information security communities such as null, OWASP and various bsides and defcon groups.\n\n**Francesco Cipollone** is a renowned entrepreneur and CISO, founder of Phoenix Security, an ASPM platform offering actionable, contextual code-to-runtime insights.

The EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA) and landmark legal decisions against Apple\u2019s app store practices are ushering in a new era of mobile security transparency and accountability. At the same time, reports like *Dark Reading\u2019s \u201cMobile Applications Are a Cesspool of Security Issues\u201d* expose the urgent need for serious mobile app and API protection strategies.\nThis talk uncovers the hidden risks of platform monocultures and challenges Apple and Google\u2019s claim that built-in security is sufficient. It offers a practical roadmap for implementing app attestation, runtime protection, and secure API communication to counteract threats such as API scraping, bot automation, credential abuse, and tampered client applications.\nWe'll dissect recent changes in regulation and litigation and explain why OWASP professionals must lead the charge in adopting more resilient, open, and developer-driven mobile security practices.\nLearning Objectives:\n\n* Understand the regulatory and legal catalysts reshaping mobile app security.\n* Learn how API attacks exploit mobile app weaknesses, despite \u201cbuilt-in\u201d platform defenses.\n* Evaluate tools and frameworks, including app attestation and RASP, that enable secure API communication.\n* Gain insights into how to implement dynamic secrets, certificate pinning, and secure client validation.\n* Explore why monopolistic behaviors hinder innovation and what OWASP chapters can do about it.\n\n**Thanks to our SPONSOR**: *[Approov](https://approov.io/)*\n*Regain Control of Your Mobile App Security.*\n*Approov is a team of passionate developers dedicated to making the future of mobile secure.

Thank you to those that attended.\n\nIn our last meetup, attendees voted for [Royal Stacks Bourke Street](https://www.royalstacks.com.au/) as our location for next month. On 2nd July 2025 6PM, there we shall meet.\n\n*There's NO BOOKING. If you're the first to arrive, please grab a table for the group and post a picture of the table's location in the comments of this meetup event. We'll use it to locate each other. (If you don't see a post, you're lucky first. Please grab us a table and post a pic. )*\n\n**Please remember to update your RSVP if you can no longer attend.** Even if it's just 30 minutes prior. It'll help whomever that arrives first know how big a table to get. We will take note of no-shows, and to make sure we've got space for those that do actually attend, your RSVP may be deprioritised for future events.\n\n**If you're having trouble finding us**, send a message to [Dan on Signal](https://signal.me/#eu/4yti0PmJCFvXhLH_vmLcxO7Xy3VAM_yY9wRhOQCA1qn7UqWh1nFBa4rNCccfHyhW).\n\nSee you there.\n\nMore details on the format, and what to expect below:\n\n**The Practitioner's Roundtable**\nIt's a monthly meetup, for AppSec/ProdSec practitioners to participate discussing AppSec/ProdSec topics and share knowledge. There's no speakers, or sponsors; just a facilitator, with the expectation that you'll join the conversations. Broadly, the idea is that you're swinging by after work, for a regular catch-up with our peers over dinner (with F&B at your own cost) with a known format.\n\\-\\-\\-\n**So, what's happening?**\nThe format:\n\n1. At 6pm all attendees arrive, and order (and pay for) their own meals - we'll do the rest while waiting for the meals to arrive and as we eat.\n2. All attendees write down on a card 1-2 AppSec/ProdSec related topics they'd like to discuss.\n3. We'll all each cast 3 votes on the cards we'd like to discuss.\n4. We'll sort the cards, and discuss the topics with the top 3-4 highest votes. Starting with the topic with the highest votes.\n5. After 5(?) minutes, we all decide if we'd like to continue or move on to the next topic.\n6. If we continue, after 15(?) minutes, we all move on to the next topic of discussion.\n7. At 7pm, we wrap up and officially end. Before everyone leaves, we vote on the next restaurant that we'll meet at.\n\nThis is[ inspired by Lean Coffee](https://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/), and intended for participants to be collaborators in the conversation focused on AppSec & ProdSec topics. *You are expected to participate in the AppSec/ProdSec conversations constructively if you attend*. This isn't the place for BizDev focused conversations.\n\nFor the location selection, here are the considerations we work with:\n\n1. It must be within 1 \"city block\" of the Melbourne Free Tram Zone.\n2. The typical price for a whole meal (without alcohol) should be under $50 per person.\n3. It must allow individual orders - you'd be ordering and paying for your own meal.\n4. It will need to have seating space for the group to say, just walk-in to the restaurant ( this may change if it grows beyond 10 regular attendees ).\n5. It must be quiet enough for us to have meaningful conversations.\n6. It must not be a restaurant we've been to in the past 6 months. (Just to keep things fresh )\n\nAlso, although we use the word \u201crestaurant\u201d this is used broadly to mean food establishment - if we\u2019re all keen on hitting up a decent kebab place, that works. As a courtesy to the venue, there's an expectation that you'd order something there."

        "description": "**The Secret Life of Malicious Packages** with **Megg Sage**\n\nSupply chain security has been all the rage recently\u2014we keep hearing story after story about malicious packages popping up across various package repositories. This talk dives into the secret life of malicious packages: what they are, where they lurk, how they operate, and the many creative ways they can wreak havoc. From innocent-seeming typosquats to the compromise of trusted, widely-used packages, we\u2019ll explore the full spectrum of threats and real-world examples that show just how sneaky (and dangerous) these packages can be.\n\nSo how can we protect ourselves from these threats? There are various options such as checking package health, source code reviews/scans, or use of tooling such as SCA tools. SCA scans, while very useful for vulnerability scanning, cannot be relied upon to protect against malicious packages. This talk will discuss their blind spots and other options for adding further protection. It will further reinforce that security should always take a multi-layered approach.\n\n**About our speaker**\nI'm an application security engineer who started out as a web developer. Security drew me in with the endless puzzles and challenges put forth by the field. I love sharing knowledge, particularly when I can both educate and horrify my audience at the same time. After all, what can happen when security goes wrong is pretty scary. I also enjoy working closely with software engineering teams to try to make security work within existing development practices, or at least try to minimize how painful \"doing security\" can be. When not behind a computer, I can usually be found making some sort of costume piece or shiny object.\n\n============\n\n**Introducing malicious package detection engineering** with **Paul McCarty**\n\nAs software supply chain attacks continue to rise in frequency and sophistication, it is crucial for security professionals to adapt their processes to address these threats effectively. One way to do this is to build a detection engineering practice to identify malicious packages as well as identify the threat indicators in those packages. In this talk, we'll examine real detection strategies, covering traditional IOCs like IP addresses and domains found in package-based malware, while also exploring package-specific indicators. Attendees will learn practical approaches to distinguish between accidentally vulnerable code and purposefully malicious packages.\n\n**Paul** is the Head of Research at Safety (safetycli.com) and a DevSecOps OG. He loves software supply chain research and delivering supply chain offensive security training and engagements. He's spent the last two years deep-diving into npm and has made several discoveries about the ecosystem. Paul founded multiple startups starting in the '90s, with UtahConnect, SecureStack in 2017, and SourceCodeRED in 2023. Paul has worked for NASA, Boeing, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, John Deere, the US military, the Australian government and several startups over the last 30 years. Paul is a frequent open-source contributor and author of several DevSecOps, software supply chain and threat modelling projects. He\u2019s currently writing a book entitled \u201cHacking NPM\u201d, and when he\u2019s not doing that, he\u2019s snowboarding with his wife and 3 amazing kids.\n\n**We would like to thank [Forward Security](https://forwardsecurity.com/) for sponsoring this event.**"
