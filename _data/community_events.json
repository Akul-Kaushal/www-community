Business users are empowered as never before, using tools that merge AI with productivity\u2014from email and business intelligence to application development. But while these tools amplify efficiency, they also introduce new security risks that challenge the traditional boundaries of IT and AppSec.\n\nAs security teams grapple with vulnerabilities like authorization misuse, data leakage, and the risk of exfiltration, they must decide how to approach the widespread adoption of AI-driven tools and low-code platforms without stifling innovation. In this session, we\u2019ll explore recent research into the security challenges posed by AI agents and low-code development, emphasizing the pitfalls that emerge when business users become app creators. We\u2019ll also outline how AppSec teams can adapt their approaches to balance security with productivity, ensuring they enable the business rather than block it."

You have DevOps tooling and CI/CD pipelines for your product release cycle. Your Dev & Ops teams work well together. You started a DevSecOps transformation to Shift Left and test code security in pipelines.\nBut how do you integrate the Security teams into DevOps to achieve true DevSecOps? Then, how do you integrate APIs, as they are behavior-based? Traditional AppSec can\u2019t identify vulnerabilities in API consumption.\nLearn how to integrate API testing into Shift Left DevSecOps pipelines to eliminate vulnerabilities. Learn how to bring Dev, Sec, Ops teams together to improve Mean Time To Remediation, and keep your teams happy!\n\n**SPONSORSHIP Opportunities Available**\n*Vendors interested in sponsoring please send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

This approach fits well with frameworks like TIBER, which focus on creating realistic simulations of cyber threats. It\u2019s all about making our defenses stronger and more effective! AI algorithms effectively analyze large datasets to identify emerging threats and tactics, aiding in realistic attack simulations. AI-driven tools help replicate complex attacks, providing red teams with thorough assessments of security measures. Using AI-generated anomalies enhances detection capabilities and strengthens incident response plans. However, the integration of AI into red teaming is not without challenges. This discussion aims to provide a nuanced overview of the application of AI in red teaming exercises, examining its potential benefits and limitations within established frameworks like TIBER. By critically evaluating this integration, we can better understand how to harness AI\u2019s capabilities to strengthen cybersecurity offense and defense.\n*Bio:*\nAli is a cybersecurity researcher with over 12 years of experience. Currently, he is the application and offensive security manager at Canon EMEA. He studied computer engineering, published articles, and holds several professional certificates. Ali is a Microsoft MVP and regular speaker or trainer at industry conferences and events.\n\n**Behind the Breach: Understanding and Preventing Web Vulnerabilities**\n*Abstract:*\n\u201cBehind the Breach: Understanding and Preventing Web Vulnerabilities delves into the transformation of modern web applications and architecture, showcasing how advancements in frameworks and browser technologies have revolutionized security. Yet, even with these innovations, attackers persist in uncovering and exploiting vulnerabilities. Drawing from real-world case studies across industries\u2014from agile startups to global enterprises\u2014this presentation not only demonstrates how a deeper understanding of security can thwart these threats, but also highlights how effectively conveying the potential impact of vulnerabilities is key to prioritizing security efforts.\u201d\n*Bio:*\nMitchel Koster is the Chief Security Researcher at Breachlock, where he leads the development of new security products and conducts research and engagements for high-profile clients. His work includes Red and Purple Team exercises and addressing custom security requirements across diverse sectors, including Aviation and Healthcare. With a background in computer science, embedded systems, and programming, Mitchel bridges the gap between modern software development practices and robust security measures.\n\nFor parking, there\u2019s a (paid) parking space less than 5 minutes away at the Q-Park Hermitage.

This meeting will be our first social, along with a \\~30min discussion of OWASP projects and structure, with lots of opportunity for input and feedback. We\u2019ll also have an intro for some of our new leadership members, discuss the great benefits of OWASP and membership, and look at the volunteer roles and opportunities we have coming up.\n\nAnd if nothing else, come warm your bones and talk security-shop with some old friends and new! Lite refreshments with heavy good times will be provided at the place we meet - upstairs at the Black Sheep - 730PM.\n\nSee you there!\nHiggs"

How WebPKI is Failing Users** (75 minutes)\n\n* For decades, WebPKI has relied on certificate revocation as a safety net to shield users from untrusted websites.\n* The issue is that our current approaches: CRLSet and OCSP, don't fully address the issue and have glaring weaknesses.\n* CRLite was born from Mozilla to challenge the status quo and make certificate revocation a reality.\n* But what lies behind CRLite's success? A fascinating journey through the realms of cryptography and hashing reveals that the solution is rooted in an unlikely place: a 50-year-old mathematical concept.\n* The answer may surprise you, but it's one that could change everything."

It\u2019s a fantastic opportunity to network with like-minded professionals, exchange ideas, and expand your knowledge in a friendly and collaborative environment.\n\n**Program:**\n**17:10** - **Doors open**: Grab a drink, meet old and new friends from the OWASP Switzerland community\n\n**17:35** - **Uninstallable by Design**: The Role of Pre-installed Apps in Android\u2019s Security Landscape - (Thomas Sutter, PhD Student @ University of Bern)\n\n**18:30** - **Coffee Break**\n\n**18:45** - **Continuous Security with DevSecOps**: How Platform Engineering Transforms Modern Application Security\u200b - (Romano Roth, Chief of DevOps / Partner @ Z\u00fchlke)\n\n**19:40 - 20:10 - Drinks, Fingerfood and Networking:** Grab a bite and chat with old and new friends\n\n**Talk details:**\n\n* **Uninstallable by Design - by Thomas Sutter**: The competitive smartphone market is keen to prevent its intellectual property from being analysed by competitors and the public. As a result, most smartphones are locked when distributed, and anti-reversing techniques are widely used. Consequently, millions of users use smartphones daily without a clear understanding of the software\u2019s functionality and purpose. To lower the bar for security researcher to analyze Android firmware, we developed a novel framework, called FirmwareDroid. In this talk, we discuss the challenges to automate the process of analyzing Android firmware and showcase how we use FirmwareDroid to analyse pre-installed Android apps in academia.\n* **Continuous Security with DevSecOps - by Romano Roth:** Security must be seamlessly integrated into every stage of the software development lifecycle. This talk explores how combining DevSecOps principles with Platform Engineering empowers teams through automation, standardized environments, and reduced complexity. Learn how these approaches transform application security into a proactive, scalable, and collaborative enabler for delivering secure, high-quality software at speed."
