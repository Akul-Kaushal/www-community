Cyberattacks are increasingly successful, targeting sensitive patient data, disrupting critical services, and putting lives at risk. Facing a growing threat landscape due to increasing reliance on interconnected technologies (including IoT, IoMT, OT and IT systems), many hospitals are struggling to recover from decades of accumulated cybersecurity debt.\n\nThis presentation will explore the root causes of healthcare cyberattacks, providing real-world examples and discussing the technical vulnerabilities that make organizations prime targets. Attendees will gain insights into the emerging guidance and strategies for improving healthcare cybersecurity, as well as the debate surrounding the need for regulation in this critical sector. We will also examine the significant financial and reputational costs associated with cyberattacks and delve into the motivations and tactics of the attackers themselves.\n\nJoin OWASP Nashville and Chad Holmes as we dive deep into the world of healthcare cybersecurity. We'll explore the root causes of cyberattacks, examine real-world examples, and discuss the technical vulnerabilities that make hospitals prime targets."

I will try to explain key quantum concepts like superposition and entanglement, contrasting them with classical computing principles.\n\nI will address security concerns by discussing the vulnerability of current cryptographic algorithms and infrastructure to quantum attacks. A brief history of cryptography and solutions to the challenges from quantum computing. Then we will outline ongoing efforts to develop quantum-resistant cryptography and the standardization processes from organizations such as NIST.\n\nOpportunities for adoption of post-quantum computing safe algorithms exist today and can be planned for and budgeted. Education and awareness will be crucial, ensuring stakeholders understand the implications of quantum computing on cybersecurity.\n\nBy the end of the presentation, attendees will gain a foundational understanding of quantum computing's impact on security and practical steps to protect sensitive data in a quantum-enabled future.\n\nWe're always looking for presenters and topics for future meetings - contact John (john.dileo@owasp.org) if you have an idea for a topic, or a presentation you'd like to make. That way, it won't always be John talking about what he's been working on recently.\n\nThe Auckland-area OWASP Meetup usually takes place on the third Tuesdays of March, May, July, September, and November. There is no Meetup in January, as our members enjoy their holidays."
