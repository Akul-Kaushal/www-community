One way for organizations to combat this growing threat is to empower their red teams to test the software supply chains for that organization. But many red teams are ill-prepared to tackle this new attack surface.\n\nThis talk will have three distinct parts:\n\n1\\. I will describe how security teams\\, red teams\\, or security researchers can quickly identify the multiple components in a particular applications software supply chain\\, and then how to find soft targets to focus on\\.\n2\\. I will describe my VBP framework \\(value\\, behaviour and patterns\\) which is an applied threat modelling framework for software supply chains\\.\n3\\.

Networking with your peers starts at 5:00 - food is served at 5:30 and the presentation starts at 6:00.\n\nThis month's meeting is brought to you by [Synopsys!](www.synopsys.com)\n\n**Presentation:** Managing the Complexity of Software Supply Chains\n\n**Abstract:**Software supply chains are significantly more complex than a traditional materials-based supply chain or B2B software procurement effort. The risk elements in software supply chains are different from those assessed during vendor risk management efforts and are constantly evolving. For example, studies have shown that the average commercial application has hundreds of component suppliers \u2013 each with their own release criteria, coding standards, and risk management.\nRegulated industries and global legislative efforts to learn how risk informed software supply chain management can function without disrupting development velocity. SBOMs are a core component of software risk management, but it\u2019s only one element. Attestations, threat models, and continuous threat monitoring transform a simple SBOM into a pillar of a modern cyber risk management program."

This is especially true since most vulnerabilities aren\u2019t actually exploitable in their real-world context, and wasting time on non-exploitable issues can get in the way of remediating the most impactful vulnerabilities.\nThis talk will explore strategies to mitigate CVE overload and streamline the vulnerability resolution process. In addition to exploring complexities around CVE noise \u2014 such as the difficulty in distinguishing between high-risk, low-risk, and no-risk vulnerabilities and the pressure to maintain business continuity while ensuring robust security \u2014 we\u2019ll analyze five specific vulnerability prioritization inputs:\n\n1. CVSS scores\n2. EPSS scores\n3. VEX\n4. The CISA KEV Catalog\n5. Reachability analysis\n\nAdditionally, the talk will cover the role of automation and tooling to prioritize vulnerabilities at scale as well as recommended workflows between IT, security teams, and business units to ensure comprehensive risk management.\n\n**Thanks to our SPONSOR**: *[FOSSA](https://fossa.com/)*\n*FOSSA is a leading application security and compliance platform that specializes in helping engineering teams deliver trusted software. FOSSA enables companies to prioritize real vulnerabilities in their open source dependencies with comprehensive SCA (software composition analysis) capabilities, while also making it possible for organizations to automate compliance reporting and SBOM (software bill of materials) lifecycle management to meet customer and regulatory requirements. Founded in 2015, FOSSA is trusted by thousands of global organizations, has been downloaded nearly two million times, and has conducted nearly 100 million open-source scans.*\n\n**Thanks to our HOST**: *[HiveWatch](https://www.hivewatch.com/)*\n*Intelligent, efficient, and scalable security*\n*HiveWatch is a cloud-based SaaS platform built for physical security teams to enhance their current security technologies.

The answer is all the above depending on the client, your development environment, and your capacity to take the risk.\n\nThis presentation will share experiences gained from penetration testing of a web application hosted by a Government agency providing professional licenses to its prospective clients. The nature of the project touched numerous areas such as CJIS (Criminal Justice Information Service), Personal Identifiable Information (PII), Access Control (Authorization in particular), and adherence to the security standard\u2019s office guidelines. The challenge was to identify and prioritize the test suite that will cover these specific areas in a constrained time period. To enhance the coverage, the test suite had to include DAST (using ZAP) and some specific general scenarios.\n\nThe audience will take away some approaches that when applied can lead to a well balanced (both effective and efficient) penetration testing.\n\nSCHEDULE\nDoors open at 5:30.

Mart\u00edn Villalba (OWASP SB).\n06.15pm -- Presentation: ChainReactor - Automated Privilege Escalation Chain Discovery via AI Planning, by Gabriel Pizarro and Ilya Grishchenko (UCSB Security Lab).\n07.00pm -- BYOT / networking.\n08.30pm -- Event end.\n\n**ChainReactor - Automated Privilege Escalation Chain Discovery via AI Planning**\nCurrent academic vulnerability research predominantly focuses on identifying individual bugs and exploits in programs and systems. However, this goes against the growing trend of modern, advanced attacks that rely on a sequence of steps (i.e., a chain of exploits) to achieve their goals, often incorporating individually benign actions.\n\nThis talk introduces a novel approach to the automated discovery of such exploitation chains using AI planning. In particular, we aim to discover privilege escalation chains, some of the most critical and pervasive security threats, which involve exploiting vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access and control over systems. We implement our approach as a tool, ChainReactor, that models the problem as a sequence of actions to achieve privilege escalation from the initial access to a target system. ChainReactor extracts information about available executables, system configurations, and known vulnerabilities on the target and encodes this data into a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) problem. Using a modern planner, ChainReactor can generate chains incorporating vulnerabilities and benign actions.\n\nWe evaluated ChainReactor on 3 synthetic vulnerable VMs, 504 real-world Amazon EC2 and 177 Digital Ocean instances, demonstrating its capacity to rediscover known privilege escalation exploits and identify new chains previously unreported. Specifically, the evaluation showed that ChainReactor successfully rediscovered the exploit chains in the Capture the Flag (CTF) machines and identified zero-day chains on 16 Amazon EC2 and 4 Digital Ocean VMs.\n\n**Speakers Bio**\nGabriel Pizarro and Ilya Grishchenko are members of the UCSB Security Lab. More info: https://seclab.cs.ucsb.edu/\n\n**BYOT: Bring Your Own Topic**\nThis meeting is a great chance to ask for technical help, career advice, share new ideas, look for feedback, and discuss anything related to CyberSecurity / InfoSec.\n\n**Location**\nKiva Cowork - Funk Zone, 10 E Yanonali St, Santa Barbara, CA. The front door will be kept open for the duration of the event. If you have any trouble getting in, please do not leave, just knock on the front or side doors and/or message us through this platform.\n\nThank you to Kiva Cowork for their partnership to host our events at their SB locations!
