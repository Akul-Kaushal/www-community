We need to rethink our approach.\nIn this talk, Haoxi will talk about trench stories over the last 6 months of running DirectCyber, a volunteer based CSIRT that tracks exposures to critical vulnerabilities and notifies potential victims with pinpoint accuracy. He will cover why this was feasible to run with 2.5-person team, how to prioritise which vulnerabilities to track, challenges for disclosure, and legal concerns. He will share success cases from other public and private sector companies such as DIVD and TruffleSec, along with the bigger picture of how we can influence government security strategy for the better if we work together."

It will delve into the vital practices of identifying, analyzing, and managing third-party dependencies to mitigate risks and ensure compliance. Attendees will discover how to integrate Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools into the CI/CD pipeline, address common challenges such as false positives and performance overhead, and deploy strategies to minimize alert noise and prioritize vulnerabilities efficiently. The aim is to streamline the SCA process, making it a seamless component of the development lifecycle and empowering participants to significantly bolster their software security posture. Join us to transform SCA from a daunting task into a manageable and integral part of your DevSecOps practices.\n\n 19:30 - 20:00 \\- Malvertising \\| tactics\\, techniques\\, and procedures \\(TTP\\) implemented in auto redirect attack\nLiran Lavi - Security Research Team Leader @ GeoEdge\nMalvertising, a fresh cyberattack tactic, entails embedding malicious code into digital advertisements. This insidious technique poses challenges for both internet users and publishers, as the infected ads are often spread through reputable advertising networks. Given that ads are visible to all website visitors and often contain many security misconfigurations, virtually every page viewer faces the threat of infection.\n\n 20:00 - 20:30 - Understanding Prompt Injection Attacks in Generative AI\nAviv Avraham Levy - Senior Security Researcher @ F5 Networks\nThis presentation provides an in-depth look at Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on the mechanics of prompt injection attacks. It highlights various types of prompt injections and showcases real-world scenarios to illustrate how these vulnerabilities can be exploited. The session includes demonstrations of prompt injection attacks in action and concludes with an overview of potential mitigation strategies.\n\n=====================================================================\n\nThis event is hosted by Playtika in collaboration with OWASP Israel.\n\nJoin us at the event physically as we will not include Zoom or remote participation this time."

In this cutting-edge session, we uncover the potential hazards that Large Language Models (LLMs) introduce to modern application ecosystems. Drawing on the expertise distilled in the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs, we offer a comprehensive roadmap for mitigating these risks. Attendees will gain insights into securing generative AI applications, recognizing the nuances of LLM vulnerabilities, and deploying defenses. This talk is a call to action for developers and security professionals to foster a culture of secure, responsible AI development. Equip yourself with the knowledge to anticipate threats, apply best practices, and build AI systems that are not only intelligent but also resilient in the face of cybersecurity challenges.\n\n**THANKS to OUR SPONSOR**: *[Kodem](https://www.kodemsecurity.com/)*\n*Kodem means \u201cfirst\u201d or \u201cearly\u201d in Hebrew.

With a large set of proposed and active laws, software development will be regulated like never before.\n\nWith the coming EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) all software and embedded systems will have to get a CE mark, which is now expanded to include cybersecurity aspects. It\u2019s going to be a huge change and will mean that the manufacturers (and in some cases importers) will get responsibility for the user\u2019s security and will have to provide free security patches for the lifetime of the product. Software developers will have to learn secure coding and the need for cyber security professionals will be very high.\n\nOne of the focus areas is vulnerability management. To keep a product secure during its lifetime, all 3rd party components will have to be monitored and up to date. At the heart of this process is the Software Bill of Materials, SBOM, which is used to monitor for known vulnerabilities in both Open Source and commercial components. The OWASP CycloneDX project fits right in and have been working with various kinds of bill-of-materials for a long time. CycloneDX is in the process of becoming an ECMA standard and thus fits better in to the EU regulation.\n\nIn this talk Olle E. Johansson will introduce the proposed EU CRA legislation and talk about the SBOM with a focus on the toolchain needed to manage vulnerabilities.\n\nWe will start the evening with a mingle at 17:30 followed by a presentation that will start at 18:00. The talk will be around 1 hour long followed by a further mingle/time for questions and answers.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nJoin OWASP Stockholm mailing list to get notified of upcoming events [https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/g/stockholm-chapter](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/g/stockholm-chapter)\nJoin our Slack channel on OWASP Slack *[#chapter-stockholm](https://owasp.slack.com/)*"

With 14 years of enterprise experience and a lifelong passion for hacking\u2014now spanning two decades\u2014Daniel brings a wealth of expertise to the cybersecurity field. He still offers some Security Architectural consultancy for different companies across Europe, and from time to time, he engages in bounty hunting. When not decoding the matrix of cyber threats, Daniel enjoys life with his wife and two boys, plays football twice a week, and maintains a spirited sense of humor\u2014because in cybersecurity, sometimes, you really can't afford to joke.\n***\\~Securing the Gates: The Hidden Flaws Behind the Firewall\\~***\nEffective cybersecurity is not just about having defenses in place but ensuring they are properly designed. 'Securing the Gates: The Hidden Flaws Behind the Firewall' illuminates the common pitfalls in firewall implementations that often go unnoticed. This presentation will demonstrate typical design errors that compromise security and provide actionable insights on how to rectify these flaws to create robust defenses. Attendees will learn how to not only deploy but also optimize firewalls to safeguard their digital assets effectively.\n\n**Alina NICULA** - **VASP Lead and Product security assessment service owner and reviewer @Visma**. Alina has been working within product development teams as a software developer, security engineer, software and cloud service architect. In the last years she focused on software security by guiding Visma teams into securing their applications, data, cloud workloads, and delivery pipelines to avoid potential cybersecurity risks.\n***\\~Running a Product Security Assessment Program at scale\\~***\nHaving a product security assessment program is essential for any company. It is equally critical to ensure that this program remains relevant over the time and is scalable as the company grows.In this presentation, I will discuss how we ensure that our designed processes empower development teams to make informed security decisions while also giving them ownership over the remediation of the security aspects that impact their products.\nHowever, achieving this goal requires a strong and knowledgeable security review team that supports the delivery teams with informed security by design best practices.\nSo, how have we been able to grow our program? I hope you will leave this presentation with a clear understanding of our approach.\n\n**Adrian BARAN -** **Security Manager @ VITESCO**,\n\n***\\~ Contingency plan from security point of view \\~***\nAbstract:"
