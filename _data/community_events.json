        "description": "In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, understanding your attack surface and adopting an adversarial perspective are critical components for building a robust security program. This talk will delve into the strategic importance of these concepts, emphasizing how they can preemptively identify and mitigate potential security threats. We will explore the methodologies behind attack surface mapping, highlighting the necessity of viewing your infrastructure through the lens of an attacker to uncover vulnerabilities that might otherwise go unnoticed. By embracing this mindset, organizations can proactively defend against sophisticated attacks, ensuring their defenses are as robust and comprehensive as possible.\n\nThe talk will shift to a demonstration, centered around the Amass Project, OWASP\u2019s powerful tool designed for in-depth attack surface mapping and asset discovery. Attendees will have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with Amass, learning how to leverage its capabilities to uncover and visualize the full extent of an organization\u2019s external exposure. The session will cover practical examples, showcasing how Amass can be integrated into security workflows to enhance situational awareness and threat intelligence. By the end of the presentation, participants will have a clear understanding of how to implement these strategies in their security programs, ultimately fortifying their defenses against potential adversaries."

We'll guide you through the process of identifying these anti-patterns and provide insights to effectively defend against such attacks.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nAnjum is the Director of Security Research at Traceable.ai. He has worked on different aspects of security engineering specifically Detection engineering & Incident response, AppSec and Threat Intelligence. He has presented at conferences like BSidesSF, BSidesCharm, and has multiple patents issued for IOT Security.\n\n**Talk 2:**\nSpeaker: Daniel Davis\n\nTitle: Had a Cyber Incident? Better Call Saul!\n\nAbstract: If you\u2019re a CISO, you\u2019re already calling your lawyer. The rest of you are going - huh??? From the SEC\u2019s legal action against Solarwinds to the looming specters of CMMC 2.0 and CIRCIA, when will cybersecurity\u2019s transformation into a legal domain be complete?\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nNo, Daniel isn\u2019t a lawyer, but he did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night (does that one still hold up???). Cybersecurity isn\u2019t the first technical discipline to be \u201clegal-lite\u201d as he learned running safety programs for military aerospace programs. When things go wrong, people will always want to know who \u201csigned off on it\u201d.\nThis experience led Daniel to Lyft\u2019s autonomous vehicle division to create a public-private partnership to develop a framework for safety and cybersecurity for AVs. Today, he\u2019s the founder of Mindpipe, which will be open sourcing a next generation, end-to-end RAG pipeline leveraging open knowledge graph frameworks."

This is especially true since most vulnerabilities aren\u2019t actually exploitable in their real-world context, and wasting time on non-exploitable issues can get in the way of remediating the most impactful vulnerabilities.\nThis talk will explore strategies to mitigate CVE overload and streamline the vulnerability resolution process. In addition to exploring complexities around CVE noise \u2014 such as the difficulty in distinguishing between high-risk, low-risk, and no-risk vulnerabilities and the pressure to maintain business continuity while ensuring robust security \u2014 we\u2019ll analyze five specific vulnerability prioritization inputs:\n\n1. CVSS scores\n2. EPSS scores\n3. VEX\n4. The CISA KEV Catalog\n5. Reachability analysis\n\nAdditionally, the talk will cover the role of automation and tooling to prioritize vulnerabilities at scale as well as recommended workflows between IT, security teams, and business units to ensure comprehensive risk management.\n\n**Thanks to our Sponsor**: *[FOSSA](https://fossa.com/)*\n*FOSSA is a leading application security and compliance platform that specializes in helping engineering teams deliver trusted software.

Learn why every SCA tool is wrong, and how to deal with it.\nJoin us for great networking, dinner and drinks, and see a presentation by **Darren Meyer**, Lead Solution Architect at Endor Labs.\n\n**ABSTRACT**: With the rise of AI-fueled by Python-based libraries, it has become of paramount importance to scan Python-based projects and their dependencies for OSS vulnerabilities. Python relies on package managers like pip or conda to manage declared dependencies. Dependencies are declared in manifest files which the package manager uses to install the correct version of the required dependency. However, Python\u2019s dependency management system coupled with its dynamic type nature makes it an especially challenging language to deal with.\n\nOf particular focus is the phenomenon of phantom dependencies which are unreported dependencies in a project's manifest profile. These hidden dependencies, which are often provided dependencies (which is especially true for libraries such as tensorflow and pytorch which are essential for AI), challenge software composition analysis (SCA) of Python code, impacting the reliability of vulnerability results.\n\n**Thanks to our Sponsor**: *[Endor Labs](https://www.endorlabs.com/)*\n*Endor Labs\u2019 Dependency Lifecycle Management Platform is designed to address the weakest link in software supply chain security: the ungoverned sprawl of open source software in the enterprise.

Our sincere apologies for the silence these past few months; it's been a rough time, in many ways. The landscape and conditions for meetups have changed, especially in the last year, thus, we must adapt to carry-on.\n\nSo, what's happening?\nThe TLDR: We'd meet at 6pm on a Wednesday monthly (except Dec/Jan), at a (different) food place each meetup. Hangout, and together contribute and decide on the AppSec topics we'd want to discuss, while we all grab a bite to eat (at own cost). All these finishing up by 7pm.\n\nFor RSVPs, please do try to keep it updated so that whomever that arrives first at the food place, can try to grab a table/seats for us. We'd be trying to just walk-in and grabbing a table.\n\nPlease see this Google Form for the details, and a quick poll on which Wednesday y'all prefer: [https://forms.gle/U3ArrazUpt9R5EGH8](https://forms.gle/U3ArrazUpt9R5EGH8)\nWe'll close this poll by the 21st June 2024.\n\nWe've picked the first event's date and location, to get the ball rolling.\nSee you there.\nThank you."

Is it the OWASP Top Ten, formal guidelines established by organizations such as NIST, security stories developed by the product owner and the security team, or recommendations made by your development team? The answer is all the above depending on the client, your development environment, and your capacity to take the risk.\n\nThis presentation will share experiences gained from penetration testing of a web application hosted by a Government agency providing professional licenses to its prospective clients. The nature of the project touched numerous areas such as CJIS (Criminal Justice Information Service), Personal Identifiable Information (PII), Access Control (Authorization in particular), and adherence to the security standard\u2019s office guidelines. The challenge was to identify and prioritize the test suite that will cover these specific areas in a constrained time period. To enhance the coverage, the test suite had to include DAST (using ZAP) and some specific general scenarios.\n\nThe audience will take away some approaches that when applied can lead to a well balanced (both effective and efficient) penetration testing.\n\nSCHEDULE\nDoors open at 5:30. The talk will begin about 6pm.\n\nENTRY\nThere are doors on Washington and Broadway. Both of them auto-lock at 6pm. From 6 to 6:15pm, only the door on Broadway will be available. Take the elevator to the 11th floor.\n\nNO ENTRY AFTER 6:15 PM\nIt will not be possible to enter the building after 6:15.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nOur host again this month is NedSpace, a co-working space in downtown Portland--a friendly place to work when you don't want to work from home.\n\nFOOD\nWe don't yet have a sponsor for July, so there may not be food this time. Plan accordingly. (If you know a company that might like to sponsor, please put them in touch with us.)"

We remotely reprogrammed the OPS-SAT's onboard FPGA with our custom cores, adding a Hardware Security Module (HSM) and a RISC-V processor. We then developed an application that captured a satellite image, processed it on the RISC-V, encrypted it on the HSM, and sent it to our ground office. There, we decrypted the image using the appropriate key and displayed it, ensuring secure data transmission.\n\nThe second use-case is an ongoing project to create an encrypted satellite communication link. This involves integrating our HSM/FPGA with an Iridium modem using the Short Burst Data (SBD) service. This setup enables us to send end-to-end hardware-encrypted messages worldwide, ensuring secure and reliable communication.\n\nThese examples demonstrate our work in enhancing secure satellite communications through advanced encryption and processing technologies.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\n**Jelizaveta Vakarjuk** is a junior researcher in Cybernetica and industrial PhD student at Tallinn University of Technology. Her research focuses on post-quantum cryptography, privacy-preserving cryptography, and security of voting systems. Mainly she studies post-quantum digital signatures, but also focuses on the aspects of migration to post-quantum cryptography.\n\n Speech: **Obstacles of migration to post-quantum cryptography**\n\nWith the rising development of quantum technologies there is an urgent need to secure existing IT infrastructure against quantum threats. Introducing post-quantum cryptography to present systems could protect them against future quantum computer attacks. Still, post-quantum migration is a challenging process which requires systematic planning and years of execution. In this talk, I will share what are the main migration obstacles in example of Estonian e-services.\n\n **And That's Not All - More Surprises Await!** Whether you're a cybersecurity professional, a tech enthusiast, or just curious about cryptography, there's something for everyone!\n\n **Connect, Collaborate, and Create:** This event is more than just talks - it's a platform to connect with like-minded folks!\n\n **Mark Your Calendars:**\nThursday 04th July at 18:30 - 20:30\nWorkland Maakri 19\n\n **Limited seats, registration on Meetup required!** "
