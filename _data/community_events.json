Most are from this year's Hacker Summer Camp. There'll also be a couple of magazines from Black Hills Infosec.*\n\nThe talk on API Security is by Andrei Agape. Here's a short synopsis and speaker bio:\n\n*This presentation will share key findings from analyzing the OpenAPI standard and 100,000 publicly available API documentations. The aim of this research is to uncovered vulnerabilities that can be detected by analyzing the documentation and how testing techniques can be improved based on these results. Attendees will gain insights into how these discoveries can enhance API pentesting methodologies, streamline vulnerability detection, and improve overall security practices.*\n\nAndrei is a Pentester and Offensive Security Specialist with a passion for web and API research as he likes finding ingenious ways to chain and exploit vulnerabilities that otherwise seem benign.\n\nThe talk on Internet Device Search is by Jonathan Andersen. Here's a short synopis and speaker bio:\n\n*This talk will cover the importance of being able to understand and quickly make sense of internet traffic as a crucial first step in identifying, investigating, and preventing many web-based attacks.*\n\n*The talk introduces the attendees to powerful and freely available tools and techniques to make sense of large amounts of IP addresses, domain names, and other web artifacts in bulk. It will focus on Webscout, an internet device search and enrichment engine made in Denmark.*\n*The talk will also show how Webscout can be used to passively and stealthily uncover web attack surfaces on a large scale, benefiting attendees in both application defense and offensive bug bounty hunting.*\n\n*After the talk, members of the audience will be equipped to understand and make informed decisions about internet traffic against their internetfacing web applications. They will be able to answer key forensic questions, such as: Is an IP address used by a popular VPN provider? Is it part of the Tor network? Does it act as a proxy or internet-wide scanner/crawler? Has it been reported anywhere else on the web, such as in popular threat feeds, forums, or MISPs?*\n\nJonathan is the co-founder and CEO of Webscout.io, a data platform focused on providing intelligence on internet devices and services at scale. He has a strong interest in cyber threat intelligence and has been working as an analyst at the Danish Ministry of Defense since 2019.\n\n**Agenda**\n18.00 Welcome\n18.05 Andrei Agape: A Deep dive into OpenAPI Security\n18.50 Pizza time\n19.30 Jonathan Andersen: Untangling the web: Making sense of (traffic from) internet appliances at scale"

However, within MOD we (like many organisations) face challenges that make Secure by Design hard for those responsible for implementing. In this talk, I will outline these challenges and talk about the role Dstl is playing to address them within MOD, and collectively with our partners across government.\n\nDr Shamal Faily is a Principal Scientist in the Software and Systems Dependability Team at Dstl. He is a Visiting Fellow at Bournemouth University, and previously held a range of academic posts at Robert Gordon University, Bournemouth University, UCL, and University of Oxford, including course leadership positions. Prior to his work in Higher Education, Shamal was a software engineer at Logica UK\u2019s Space & Defence division for nearly a decade. Shamal has long established interests in the design and secure and usable systems, and published over 100 peer-reviewed publications in Software Engineering, Cyber Security, HCI, and Computer Science Education. Shamal is also the lead developer of the open-source CAIRIS (Computer Aided Integration of Requirements and Information Security) platform, which is widely used for threat modelling.\n\n**Hays**\nCyber recruitment update from the Hays team.\n\n**Ashley Allen**\nNowadays, domestic smart security devices, such as smart locks, smart doorbells, and security cameras, are becoming increasingly popular with users due to their ease of use, convenience, and declining prices. Unfortunately, users have very few sources of unbiased information regarding product performance in real-world conditions and, as a result, tend to take manufacturer claims at face value. This means that users may be exposed to threats such as theft, impersonation, and even physical injury if the device fails and is used to prevent access to hazardous environments. This talk discusses recently published research, and in particular several attacks using popular wireless attack vectors (i.e., 433 MHz radio, Bluetooth, and RFID) against domestic smart security devices. Results suggest that users are open to considerable threats, irrespective of whether they use lesser known (i.e., no name) or branded smart security devices, due to the poor security offered by these devices.\n\nAshley Allen is a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Hertfordshire and a member of the Cybersecurity and Computing Systems research group. He holds an MSc in Computer Science (Cybersecurity) from Staffordshire University, UK. He has over 20 years of experience working in security roles in both the public and private sectors. He is currently Senior Security Engineer for Posit, PBC, an American data science company. His research interests include IoT security and federated learning.\n\n**Event and Venue**\nWe will be joining Hays Recruitment in their new offices in Bournemouth for this event, there is a limit on numbers, so signup is essential. Names will be required upon arrival to enter the building.\n\nThere will be food and drink provided for this event, so please let us know of any dietary requirements or allergies."

Johan Sydseter**\n\n**Gamification of Threat Modeling for Machine Learning**\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has established itself as an important part of our lives, with machine learning spearheading the most notable innovations in the last two decades. Publications about prompt injection and similar attacks get a lot of attention. However, these are far from the only security issues with machine learning systems. We also have to think about challenges like poisoned data, recursive data pollution and all the personally identifiable information the models have memorized, as well as other inherent weaknesses with stochastic systems. Too much focus is directed towards operational security in the OPS part of of MLOps, while the shift-left idea of building systems \"secure by design\" during planning and development does not get enough emphasis. Threat modeling and risk analysis will likely play an important role in the future of machine learning security. I introduce Elevation of MLsec, which is an extension of Shostack's threat modeling card game Elevation of Privilege, and based on the risk framework published by the Berryville Institute of Machine Learning (BIML). In this talk, we will demystify how machine learning systems actually work and explore how the threat modeling game can help us engineer more secure machine learning systems.\n\n**Let\u2019s play OWASP Cornucopia!**\nOWASP Cornucopia is a card game to assist software development teams identify security requirements in agile software development processes. It is language, platform, and technology agnostic.\n\nIn this session we will learn to play the game in a different way from what we usually do. Johan Sydseter, OWASP Cornucopia co-lead and game master will take you through a provocative scenario. Confronted with the grumpy old senior developer that refuses to shift-left due to too many hours working overtime on his incredible sophisticated pet projects, what will you do? Will you be able to teach him a lesson about why security is important, or will he be laughing all the way to his developer cave? Only true passionate application security engineers will succeed. Expect confetti, swags, (yes, you read right, swag, valued just below the corruption limit) and illegal bribes as you venture into the unknown of OWASP Cornucopia.\n\n**Speakers**\n\n**Elias Brattli S\u00f8rensen** is a software engineer & security champion at Kantega SSO, engineering digital identity standards for secure authentication to the Atlassian ecosystem while facilitating and promoting secure software development practices. M. Sc. in Computer Science at NTNU, researching usage of static analysis tools like Spotbugs to find vulnerabilities in OpenID Connect client implementations.\n\n**Johan Sydseter** is co-leader for OWASP\u00ae Cornucopia and Co-creator of the OWASP\u00ae Cornucopia Mobile App Edition. The man with the long hair, not the long beard. Fresh meat in App Sec and OWASP but has 15 years' experience building and designing backend and frontend solutions as a designer, developer and architect. He has held several presentations on appsec at various international conferences, loves confetti and funny glasses.\n\n**About OWASP and OWASP Chapter meetings**\nOWASP is an online community that produces freely available articles, methods, documentation, tools, and technologies in IoT, system software, and web application security.\nOWASP Chapters exist to build a community of application security professionals worldwide. Our Oslo OWASP Chapter's meetings are free and open to everyone to attend, so both members and non-members are always welcome.

However, by design, JWTs contain numerous security and cryptography pitfalls that can lead to serious vulnerabilities. In this talk, we will explore how to exploit some of these issues.\n2. **OAuth Secrets (Grzegorz Niedziela)**\nThese days, Oauth is a key protocol, allowing us to log in with one click to many websites. As anything, this convenience doesn\u2019t come without a cost. The cost here is the risk of an account takeover bug. And that\u2019s not only changing the redirect_uri to an attacker-controlled host which, for many hackers, is the only attack they know. That attack won't work too well in 2024. This talk will be about exploiting smaller misconfigurations. For example, what do to if you only control the path of the redirect_uri or how to exfiltrate the code when your open doesn't preserve parameters. It will also focus on particular auth providers and how they don't make it hard for us by being way more relaxed than the standard defines.\n3. After the break, we will be hosting a **discussion about bug boutnty**. We want to discuss both sides - bug bounters and companies which have bug bounty programs.\nHow to report vulnerabilities?

Securing APIs in the Cloud: Insights and Best Practices- Palo Alto***\nThis presentation explores the security challenges and opportunities in containerization, emphasizing a defense-in-depth approach. We begin by discussing the widespread adoption of containers and the emerging trends driving innovation, such as serverless computing and hybrid/multi-cloud environments. We then examine key security concerns, including container sprawl, misconfigurations, and supply chain vulnerabilities. A defense-in-depth strategy, starting with shifting security left during development, followed by securing images at rest and implementing runtime protection, ensures comprehensive container security. By integrating cloud workload protection platforms (CWPP) with broader CNAPP strategies, organizations can safeguard containers throughout their entire lifecycle, from code to production\n\n***III. From Reactive to Effective: Building Application Security that Works-Mend IO***\n\nIn 2023, 71% of enterprises admitted their AppSec programs were reactive, playing catch-up with vulnerability alerts -\u2013 while at the same time, applications remain the top target for threat actors. That adds up to increased business risk for a lot of companies and fuels an urgent need to improve application security strategies. But how?\nThe key is to move from a compliance-based approach to managing application risk."

A great reason to hold a special Stammtisch outside of the regular schedule!\n\nThis is the most exciting time in the history of appsec. Not only are apps/APIs more complex, connected, and critical than ever before, we haven't made much progress against vulnerabilities, the attackers have ramped up their activity dramatically, and the governments of the world are scrambling to figure out what to do. It's a mess. In this talk, Jeff will share some stories and insights from over 25 years in appsec. We'll look at some of the bigger movements in appsec like \"build security in\", \"devsecops\", \"shift left\", \"SBOMs\", and \"secure by design\" and talk about why they have largely failed to change the trajectory of appsec. We'll also spend some time on the different technologies organizations use to automate appsec in development and operations. Jeff will share his thoughts about the market failures that make improvements in appsec so difficult and what we can do to fix them. This will be a highly interactive session, so bring your questions and ideas.\n\n**Novatec Consulting** will host this Stammtisch at their venue \u2013 thank you very much, we truly appreciate your support in making this event possible!\n\nThe exact details of this Stammtisch are still being finalized and will be shared here soon."
