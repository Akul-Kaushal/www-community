In this cutting-edge session, we uncover the potential hazards that Large Language Models (LLMs) introduce to modern application ecosystems. Drawing on the expertise distilled in the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs, we offer a comprehensive roadmap for mitigating these risks. Attendees will gain insights into securing generative AI applications, recognizing the nuances of LLM vulnerabilities, and deploying defenses. This talk is a call to action for developers and security professionals to foster a culture of secure, responsible AI development. Equip yourself with the knowledge to anticipate threats, apply best practices, and build AI systems that are not only intelligent but also resilient in the face of cybersecurity challenges.\n\n**THANKS to OUR SPONSOR**: *[Kodem](https://www.kodemsecurity.com/)*\n*Kodem means \u201cfirst\u201d or \u201cearly\u201d in Hebrew.

But how do you know if you are actually using the vulnerable code? This talk will show you how to use two different types of tools to analyze reachability \u2013 deciding if the vulnerability needs to be prioritized based on your own code usage.\n\n**Workshop Overview:**\nThe workshop will be broken into several modules; introductory modules will cover the workshop organization and administrative matters (installing and configuring the tools used in the workshop). Subsequent modules will give an outline of what vulnerability reachability is and why it is important and compare/contrast the two main ways of understanding reachability (static call graphs and runtime analysis).\n\nNext, the workshop will present two short exercises, intended for the attendees to gain hands-on experience using both types of tools against real applications with real vulnerabilities. Interpreted languages (Java) and compiled languages (C/C++/Go) will be covered. Subsequently, the following module will walk through how to interpret the results obtained from the exercises and draw conclusions. The languages chosen are merely representative; the skills learned in the workshop are equally applicable to other languages.\n\nThe workshop will conclude with two modules which will present a short overview of commercial tools and a conclusion/wrap-up/Q&A session.\n\n**Workshop Outline:**\nI. Overview (10 minutes)\nA. Workshop organization\nB. About the tools and sample applications\n\n1. What are the tools and applications we are going to use?\n\nC. Obtaining/installing the tools and sample applications\n2\\. Cloning from the github repo\n\nD. Goals of the workshop (what you will learn)\n3\\.

Become familiar with some of the tools available to help with\nvulnerability reachability\n\n5\\. Learn where you can reach out to for more help in these areas\nafter the completion of the workshop\n\nII. Types of reachability analysis (10 minutes)\nA. Static analysis / call graphs\n6\\. What is a call graph?\n7\\. What information does a call graph provide to you\n\nB. Runtime analysis\nC. Language and environment considerations\n8\\.

Bj\u00f8rstad and Erlend Leiknes, mnemonic\n* **18:15-19:00 Testing race conditions has never been faster,** Sofia Lindqvist, Binary Security\n\n**Finding a three 0-day exploit chain in Ivanti EPMM and Ivanti Sentry**\nDuring the summer of 2023, a team at mnemonic discovered three 0-day vulnerabilities in Ivanti Endpoint Protection Manager Mobile (EPMM, formerly known as Mobileiron Core) and Ivanti Sentry.\n\n* CVE-2023-35078: authentication bypass in Ivanti EPMM, CVSS 9.8\n* CVE-2023-35081: path traversal / arbitrary file write in Ivanti EPMM, CVSS 7.2\n* CVE-2023-38035: authentication bypass in Ivanti Sentry, CVSS 9.8, allowing command execution as root.\n\nAll three vulnerabilities are listed in CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, as they are known to have been exploited by threat actors in the wild. Ivanti has also confirmed that the vulnerabilities can be combined in an exploit chain.\nIn this talk we'll take a closer look at what actually happened.\n\n**Speakers**\n\n* **Tor E. Bj\u00f8rstad** has spent his entire career in security and privacy. For the last decade he has worked as a principal security consultant at mnemonic, based in Oslo. He has mainly focused on software security and security architecture, with a particular interest in society-critical infrastructure. Tor holds a Ph.d. in cryptography from the University of Bergen.\n* **Erlend Leiknes**, a security consultant at mnemonic as, Oslo, spends his days as a penetration tester. His professional motto is that most vulnerabilities are obvious, the endeavor is to look at the right places. Erlend holds a master's degree in technical societal safety from University of Stavanger.\n\n**TESTING RACE CONDITIONS HAS NEVER BEEN FASTER**\n\nHistorically, testing for race condition vulnerabilities in web apps has been a painful ordeal, likely making race conditions an under-explored attack vector. In the summer of 2023, groundbreaking research by James Kettle completely changed the game, suddenly making it much easier for pentesters (and attackers) to test for this type of vulnerability. In this talk I will show how race conditions work, how to test for them and how to protect against them, based off an example vulnerability I found during a recent pentest.\n\n**Speaker**\n\n**Sofia Lindqvist**, security specialist, Binary Security\n\nSofia works as a security specialist at Binary Security. She started her career with a PhD in pure maths, followed by three years at Cisco developing one of their networking OSs. She eventually made her way into security testing, which she has been doing for a year and a half."

However, the current market focus is overly focused on network architecture, overlooking the elephant in the room.\n\nIn a modern application architecture, APIs are the backbone of interconnecting microservices. This means APIs are the most closely related \u2018services\u2019 to an organization\u2019s data, which explains why advanced attackers target APIs. In this session, we will explain how the zero-trust concept protects APIs."

        "description": "EU is about to become a market leader in software cybersecurity regulation. With a large set of proposed and active laws, software development will be regulated like never before.\n\nWith the coming EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) all software and embedded systems will have to get a CE mark, which is now expanded to include cybersecurity aspects. It\u2019s going to be a huge change and will mean that the manufacturers (and in some cases importers) will get responsibility for the user\u2019s security and will have to provide free security patches for the lifetime of the product. Software developers will have to learn secure coding and the need for cyber security professionals will be very high.\n\nOne of the focus areas is vulnerability management. To keep a product secure during its lifetime, all 3rd party components will have to be monitored and up to date. At the heart of this process is the Software Bill of Materials, SBOM, which is used to monitor for known vulnerabilities in both Open Source and commercial components. The OWASP CycloneDX project fits right in and have been working with various kinds of bill-of-materials for a long time. CycloneDX is in the process of becoming an ECMA standard and thus fits better in to the EU regulation.\n\nIn this talk Olle E. Johansson will introduce the proposed EU CRA legislation and talk about the SBOM with a focus on the toolchain needed to manage vulnerabilities.\n\nWe will start the evening with a mingle at 17:30 followed by a presentation that will start at 18:00. The talk will be around 1 hour long followed by a further mingle/time for questions and answers.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nJoin OWASP Stockholm mailing list to get notified of upcoming events [https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/g/stockholm-chapter](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/g/stockholm-chapter)\nJoin our Slack channel on OWASP Slack *[#chapter-stockholm](https://owasp.slack.com/)*"
