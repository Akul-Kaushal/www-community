We\u2019ll be changing our format this month to a more hands-on approach to Application Security with a Capture the Flag event. Whether you\u2019re an experienced Application Penetration Tester or brand new for the AppSec world, there will be something for everyone.\n\nOWASP Boulder\u2019s own Mark Hoopes has found a truly insecure CRM application ready to be exploited. Entry level participants can explore a poorly designed authorization system and mid-level hackers will have plenty of opportunities to run SQL and JavaScript Injection attacks. For the experts, there is even a pathway to shell, but it will take some real dedication to get there.\n\nTo ensure everyone has a good time, we'll be encouraging experienced participants to team up with those who are new to web exploitation. On top of that, a walkthrough document will be available and exploit demos will be given gradually throughout the evening.\n\nBring your own laptop with an intercepting proxy (Burp, ZAP, etc.) installed to participate as an attacker, but if you\u2019re not comfortable at that level, feel free to just bring yourself and plan to shadow, watch, and learn.\n\nInstallation instructions can be found here:\n[https://www.meristeminfosec.com/resources/boulder-ctf](https://www.meristeminfosec.com/resources/boulder-ctf)\n\nTo make sure everyone comes prepared, a Q&A session will be held on the Monday before the event at 7pm: [https://meet.google.com/ddn-zozh-ysv](https://meet.google.com/ddn-zozh-ysv)\n\nSpecial thanks to the Rule4 Team for hosting and sponsoring, we couldn't do these events without our sponsors.

Les sujets sont propos\u00e9s par les participants lors de la s\u00e9ance. Partages de connaissances, retour d'exp\u00e9riences, exercices de type CTF, bonnes pratiques, gouvernance et organisation, ... sont au programme!\n\n**Lightning Talks:**\nLa soir\u00e9e commence par de courtes pr\u00e9sentations. Chacun peut s'il le veut proposer une pr\u00e9sentation, ce n'est pas obligatoire. Si vous avez envie de partager une technique, une opinion, une d\u00e9mo ou un retour d'exp\u00e9rience, alors vous pouvez pr\u00e9parer un lightning talk, entre une simple phrase et 10 minutes maxi et venez le pr\u00e9senter au d\u00e9but de la soir\u00e9e. Si vous n'avez jamais fait de pr\u00e9sentation avant, c'est l'occasion de commencer dans une ambiance sympa.\n\n**Workshop:**\nLa soir\u00e9e se poursuit avec des activit\u00e9s men\u00e9es en groupes. Chacun peut s'il le veut proposer un sujet, ce n'est pas obligatoire. Vous avez 30 secondes au d\u00e9but de la session pour en donner envie aux autres participants, puis tout le monde vote pour son sujet favori. Les sujets pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s donnent lieu \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s en groupes pendant un peu plus d'une heure. Des \u00e9crans seront disponibles\n\nLe format se veut bienveillant. Pas besoin d'\u00eatre expert pour parler d'un sujet. Vous trouverez certainement d'autres personnes pour vous aider! L'accent est mis sur l'\u00e9change et le partage.\n\nL'agenda et le compte-rendu des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents meetups est accessible ici: https://owasp.org/www-chapter-france/"

Often we point to the amorphous blob that is web security and go: \"here you go, now you can be a hacker too\", with top 10 lists, write-ups, conference talks and whitepapers smiling as we do. This creates a major challenge for developers who want to test their APIs for security or just people who want to get into API hacking, how on earth do you wade through all the general web security to get to the meat of API hacking, what do you even need to know?\nThis talk is going to break down API hacking from a developer point of view, teaching you everything you need to know about API hacking, from the bugs you can find and to the impact you can cause, to how you can easily test your own work or review your peers.\n\n**\"Maturing Your Application Security Program\"** \\- Tanya Janca\nAfter working with over 300 companies on their application security programs the most common question I receive is \u201cwhat\u2019s next?\u201d. They want to know how to mature their programs, and when they look at the maturity models available, they find them intimidating and so far beyond their current maturity level that they feel impossible. In this talk I will take you through 3 common AppSec program maturity levels I have encountered over the years, with practical and actionable next steps you could take immediately to improve your security posture.\n\n**\"The news is that 2025 is the year of Agentic AI, but what IS Agentic AI?**\" - Spyros Gasteratos (Lightning Talk)\nIn this lighting talk we\u2019ll start the new year with a small primer on what are agents and how they\u2019re used. We\u2019ll briefly discuss use cases and how we\u2019ve seen people use them. We\u2019ll close with security considerations we\u2019ve seen and an obligatory list of getting started resources\n\n**SPEAKERS**\n\n**Dr Katie Paxton-Fear ([@insiderPhD](https://x.com/@insiderPhD))**\nDr Katie Paxton-Fear is an API hacker and content creator at Traceable. She has a PhD in cyber security and artificial intelligence, but if you know her it\u2019s not for her academic work.\nShe\u2019s a hacker and YouTuber who's found bugs in over 30 companies. She wants to show that anyone can be a hacker, and share her passion and knowledge with others. She has hacked everything from the military to social media, reporting her findings promptly and making sure the attackers don't get their first! In her free time she makes videos, teaching her audience of 80k+ how to get into ethical hacking. You can\nfind her all over the internet as InsiderPhD.\n\n**Tanya Janca ([@shehackspurple](https://twitter.com/shehackspurple))**\nTanya Janca, also known as SheHacksPurple, is the best-selling author of \u2018Alice and Bob Learn Application Security\u2019.

ChatGPT and similar technologies have taken the world by storm, showing an astonishing ability to create text, images and even videos that are barely distinguishable from human produced content. Many businesses have jumped in the bandwagon and countless companies are integrating these models into their product lines as fast as they possibly can. They certainly do produce excellent results in many situations and save time and money. But how secure are they really? In this talk, we will discuss two examples of models that are heavily adopted and, while very effective, are also easily compromised, and are much more insecure than previously understood. With no fix on the horizon, wild adoption of these models is shown to be problematic.\n\n**Speakers:**\n**Guy-Vincent Jourdan Ph.D.**\nDr. Guy-Vincent Jourdan is a professor at the University of Ottawa's School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, where he has been a key contributor since 2004. He holds a Ph.D. from l'Universit\u00e9 de Rennes/INRIA in France, earned in 1995, with a specialization in distributed systems analysis. Prior to his academic career, Dr. Jourdan gained extensive industry experience as C.T.O. and later C.E.O. of Decision Academic Graphics, an Ottawa-based company.\nHis research at the University of Ottawa spans critical areas such as software verification, validation, testing, software security, and cybercrime protection. An accomplished scholar, Dr. Jourdan has co-authored more than a hundred scientific publications and holds 15 patents. He also serves as co-director of the uOttawa-IBM Cyber Range, a cutting-edge facility dedicated to cybersecurity research and training.\nDr. Jourdan\u2019s work focuses on developing proactive strategies to detect, prevent, and recover from cyber threats, with particular expertise in early detection of phishing sites and cybercrime mitigation.\n\n**William Aiken**\nWilliam Aiken is a PhD student at the University of Ottawa. He majored in Security and Risk Analysis at Penn State University under the cybersecurity track, and received his Master\u2019s in Electronic and Computer Engineering from Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea. His current research work lies at the intersection of many fields including synthetic data generation (such as diffusion models!), federated learning, and augmented reality. His research also emphasizes security and vulnerability assessments on deep learning models and bringing tangible DL applications to a variety of domains."

Strategies for Aligning Programs with Modern Expectations***\n***Vipul Gupta-SVP Frost Bank***\nIn this talk, Vipul plans to share his experience with building and scaling an Application Security program. He will share why engaging with development and business teams is essential for the Shift Left journey.\n\n***II. Cultivating Developer Adoption in the era of Artificial Intelligence-Snyk***\nIn today\u2019s fast-paced, AI-driven development landscape, securing developer adoption is key to integrating security seamlessly into workflows. This presentation explores practical strategies to overcome challenges like trust, tooling complexity, and unclear ownership. By focusing on people, processes, and tools, we demonstrate how to empower developers, reduce friction, and scale security effectively. Attendees will gain actionable insights to foster a collaborative culture where security becomes a natural part of development.\nOne of the biggest challenges that organizations face when shifting left is getting developers to actually adopt the \u201cshift left\" tools. This presentation speaks to how to overcome that.\n\n***III.*** **Development Team Transformation -Contrast Security**\nThe lines between proactive and reactive cyber defenses are somewhat arbitrary. If you blur those lines, you can some serious advantages. A SAST or SCA tool finding is a theoretical vulnerability that may or may not be exploitable, but if you can see that a vulnerability is within the blast radius of active probes or attacks, it suddenly becomes real. What might have been labeled as \"critical\" in pre-prod suddenly becomes \"super-critical\". On the other hand, things that are not exploitable in a production context due to compensating control, can be deprioritized preserving the limited attention of development for things that really matter. Join DevSecOps pioneer, Larry Maccherone, for this thought-provoking discussion on going right to shift left\n\n***IV.*** **Shift Left: Design for Security and Quality**-**CheckMarx**\nThis presentation will discuss the elements of design phase security, highlighting the critical role of design decisions in achieving a secure and high-quality software product."

AppSec teams navigating distributed environments often are dealing with disjointed efforts\u2014developers rushing to patch but not knowing where to start, detection teams crafting exploit rules that could be passed, and threat hunters investigating past compromises\u2014potentially leaving current critical vulnerabilities unaddressed. Teams need a way to connect the dots from when an application is launched to when it\u2019s being attacked. Enter tracing. Tracing requests, enables organizations to quickly identify the source of an attack, mitigate its impact, and enforce necessary measures to prevent additional impact, and provide the needed context to patch. Incorporating tracing can remove the challenges found in distributed applications. In this session, you'll learn:\n\n* What application traces are and how to use them\n* How tracing can be used to investigate and detect attacks\n* Why tracing enhances application security efforts"
