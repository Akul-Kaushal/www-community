Pizza and soda will be provided.\n\nIn this session Jerry will be talking about **The AI AppSec Nightmare**.\n\nThe era of AI-powered attackers is no longer theoretical. Autonomous and semi-autonomous tools are now capable of identifying, exploiting, and adapting to vulnerabilities at a scale and speed that surpass human capacity. This talk explores the implications of a world where AI-driven threats are a permanent part of the landscape.\nWe begin with a candid look at the current state of application security, where manual processes and outdated risk models struggle to keep pace with modern development. At the same time, AI-generated code is entering environments at an unprecedented rate, often with little to no review, expanding the attack surface in ways few organizations are prepared for.\nCompounding the problem is a growing wave of global regulations pushing organizations to demonstrate security readiness, often without providing practical paths to achieve it. Within this context, the traditional approach of prioritizing and fixing only critical and high-severity issues is breaking down. Attackers, especially those leveraging AI, no longer view low or medium vulnerabilities as difficult hurdles. Most vulnerabilities should now be treated as easily exploitable.\nThis session offers a sharp, forward-looking assessment of the challenges ahead and outlines key shifts that application security teams must make to stay relevant and effective in the age of AI.\n\nJerry Hoff has decades of experience in technology and security, specializing in application security at an enterprise scale. He holds a Master\u2019s in Computer Science from Washington University in St. Louis and has evaluated the security of applications for some of the largest financial, defense, and commercial organizations in the world.\n\nAs a security entrepreneur, Jerry founded and led a static application security testing startup, which was acquired by WhiteHat Security in 2011. He has been an active member of the security community for nearly twenty years as a lifetime member and long-time volunteer with OWASP.\n\nJerry has held key leadership roles in global organizations, including serving as the Global Head of Security for Sony Electronics and as a Group Senior Security Architect for NTT. His expertise spans secure software development, application security strategy, and enterprise security architecture. He now leads [AppSecTraining.com](http://appsectraining.com/), a company dedicated to training organizations on secure software development. Jerry also is highly involved in cybersecurity startups, and is an investor in multiple startups and funds, and is a strategic advisor to Pixee.ai."

Registration required.**\n**This event will be live-streamed on YouTube.**\n**Recordings will be available on the OWASP London YouTube channel.**\n\n**Venue Location**: Civo Tech Junction, First Floor, 32-37 Cowper Street, London, EC2A 4AW\n**Nearest Tube:** Old Street (Northern Line), Cowper Street exit - 1 min walk\n**Doors Open at 6pm** for registration, pizza, drinks and networking. The talks start at 6:30pm (we start on time!).\n\n**TALKS:**\n\n**OWASP Introduction, Welcome and News** \\- Sam Stepanyan\\, Andra Lezza\\, Sherif Mansour \\- OWASP London Chapter Leaders\n\n**\"Server-Side Cross-Site Scripting\" - Balazs Bucsay**\n\nCross-Site Scripting is no longer a new or hot topic, but as new technologies are introduced rapidly, and with the expansion of cloud solutions and containerisation, classic vulnerabilities may take on new forms. Server-Side XSS is an unusual method to execute malicious payloads on the server rather than the client.\nThe talk includes multiple demos that walk the audience through an attack chain utilising multiple vulnerabilities and misconfigurations to escalate privileges, and to transform a seemingly benign vulnerability into a powerful tool for cloud account takeover. In addition to explaining the issue with Server-Side XSS, its limitations and capabilities will also be discussed. Recommendations will be provided to prevent others from making the same mistakes that are already widespread.\n\n**\"Securing the Software Supply Chain in the Age of AI, Malware, and Compliance\" - Matthew Brady**\n\nModern development teams rely heavily on third-party code, AI-generated content, and rapid release cycles\u2014making the software supply chain a growing target for attackers. At the same time, security teams are expected to manage increasing compliance demands and prevent threats like dependency confusion and malicious packages, all without slowing down developers. This talk focuses on how AppSec teams can build practical, scalable approaches to securing the software supply chain, drawing from real-world challenges and lessons learned across the industry.\n\n**RAFFLE - win a prize kindly donated by our sponsors!**\n\n**SPEAKERS**\n\n**Balazs Bucsay**\n\nBalazs Bucsay is the founder & CEO of Mantra Information Security that offers a variety of consultancy services in the field of IT Security. With decades of offensive security experience he is focusing his time mainly on research in various fields including red teaming, reverse engineering, embedded devices, firmware emulation and cloud. He gave multiple talks around the globe (Singapore, London, Melbourne, Honolulu) on different advanced topics and released several tools and papers about the latest techniques. He has multiple certifications (OSCE, OSCP, OSWP) related to penetration testing, exploit writing and other low-level topics and degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science. Balazs thinks that sharing knowledge is one of the most important things, so he always shares it with his peers. Because of his passion for technology he starts the second shift right after work to do some research to find new vulnerabilities.\n\n**Matthew Brady**\n\nMatthew has a unique combination of technical knowledge with commercial awareness in many areas including Software Application Security, DevOps and software development lifecycle solutions and services across multiple vertical markets. Matthew currently leads a team of Solution Engineers in EMEA and is subject matter expert in Black Duck supply chain solutions. Prior to that he has worked for CISCO/AppDynamics and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\n\n**TICKETS:**\n\nOWASP meetups are free and open to anyone interested in application security. Please note that you MUST book your place to be admitted to the event by the building security.\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT:**\n\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

But while powerful, these tools carry risks: trained on vast public datasets, they inherit bad patterns without necessarily ensuring secure application development. In this talk, we'll share five key lessons for security engineers and developers to improve code security:\n\n* Implement guardrails\n* Get real-time security signal\n* Watch your dependency blast radius\n* Compensate for non-determinism\n* Invest in prompt engineering\n\n**Presentation #2: The AI Appsec Nightmare - Jerry Hoff**\n\nThe era of AI-powered attackers is no longer theoretical. Autonomous and semi-autonomous tools are now capable of identifying, exploiting, and adapting to vulnerabilities at a scale and speed that surpass human capacity. This talk explores the implications of a world where AI-driven threats are a permanent part of the landscape.\n\nWe begin with a candid look at the current state of application security, where manual processes and outdated risk models struggle to keep pace with modern development. At the same time, AI-generated code is entering environments at an unprecedented rate, often with little to no review, expanding the attack surface in ways few organizations are prepared for.\n\nCompounding the problem is a growing wave of global regulations pushing organizations to demonstrate security readiness, often without providing practical paths to achieve it. Within this context, the traditional approach of prioritizing and fixing only critical and high-severity issues is breaking down. Attackers, especially those leveraging AI, no longer view low or medium vulnerabilities as difficult hurdles. Most vulnerabilities should now be treated as easily exploitable.\n\nThis session offers a sharp, forward-looking assessment of the challenges ahead and outlines key shifts that application security teams must make to stay relevant and effective in the age of AI."
