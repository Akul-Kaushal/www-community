        "description": "**TOPIC**: Breaking Through CVE Noise: Analyzing 5 Key Prioritization Inputs\nJoin us for great networking, dinner and drinks, and see a presentation by **Chelsea Boling**, a Customer Success Architect at **FOSSA**\n\n**ABSTRACT**: Thousands of new Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) are reported each year, which puts a massive burden on security teams to prioritize and address the most critical threats effectively. This is especially true since most vulnerabilities aren\u2019t actually exploitable in their real-world context, and wasting time on non-exploitable issues can get in the way of remediating the most impactful vulnerabilities.\nThis talk will explore strategies to mitigate CVE overload and streamline the vulnerability resolution process. In addition to exploring complexities around CVE noise \u2014 such as the difficulty in distinguishing between high-risk, low-risk, and no-risk vulnerabilities and the pressure to maintain business continuity while ensuring robust security \u2014 we\u2019ll analyze five specific vulnerability prioritization inputs:\n\n1. CVSS scores\n2. EPSS scores\n3. VEX\n4. The CISA KEV Catalog\n5. Reachability analysis\n\nAdditionally, the talk will cover the role of automation and tooling to prioritize vulnerabilities at scale as well as recommended workflows between IT, security teams, and business units to ensure comprehensive risk management.\n\n**Thanks to our SPONSOR**: *[FOSSA](https://fossa.com/)*\n*FOSSA is a leading application security and compliance platform that specializes in helping engineering teams deliver trusted software. FOSSA enables companies to prioritize real vulnerabilities in their open source dependencies with comprehensive SCA (software composition analysis) capabilities, while also making it possible for organizations to automate compliance reporting and SBOM (software bill of materials) lifecycle management to meet customer and regulatory requirements. Founded in 2015, FOSSA is trusted by thousands of global organizations, has been downloaded nearly two million times, and has conducted nearly 100 million open-source scans.*\n\n**Thanks to our HOST**: *[HiveWatch](https://www.hivewatch.com/)*\n*Intelligent, efficient, and scalable security*\n*HiveWatch is a cloud-based SaaS platform built for physical security teams to enhance their current security technologies. It streamlines incident response, allows for the consolidation of disparate programs and systems, and reduces false alarms.*\n\n**SPONSORSHIP Opportunities Available**\n*Vendors interested in sponsoring please send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

        "description": "G'day all,\n\nWe had a great meetup last month. Thank you to those that attended.\nTo make it easier, let's call this new format \"Practitioner's Roundtable\". We'll keep this going for the rest of this year. Following the survey last month of when you'd like to have these meetings, 66.7% of you told us you'd prefer the last Wednesday of the month - so, it shall be.\n\nIn our last meetup, attendees voted for [Dr. Watson's Bar in the CBD](https://www.thesherlockholmes.com.au/dr-watsons-bar/) as our location this month. On 31st July 2024 6PM, there we shall meet.\n\n*There's NO BOOKING. If you're the first to arrive, please grab a table for the group and post a picture of the table's location in the comments of this meetup event. We'll use it to locate each other. (If you don't see a post, you're lucky first. Please grab us a table and post a pic.* \\*)\\*\n\nPlease remember to update your RSVP if you can no longer attend. Even if it's just 30 minutes prior. It'll help whomever that arrives first know how big a table to get.\n\nWe're looking forward to the discussions we had once again.\nSee you there.\n\nMore details on the format, and what to expect below:\n\n**The Practitioner's Roundtable**\nIt's a monthly meetup, for AppSec/ProdSec practitioners to participate discussing AppSec/ProdSec topics and share knowledge. There's no speakers, or sponsors; just a facilitator, with the expectation that you'll join the conversations. Broadly, the idea is that you're swinging by after work, for a regular catch-up with our peers over dinner (with F&B at your own cost) with a known format.\n\\-\\-\\-\n**So, what's happening?**\nThe format:\n\n1. At 6pm all attendees arrive, and order (and pay for) their own meals - we'll do the rest while waiting for the meals to arrive and as we eat.\n2. All attendees write down on a card 1-2 AppSec/ProdSec related topics they'd like to discuss.\n3. We'll all each cast 3 votes on the cards we'd like to discuss.\n4. We'll sort the cards, and discuss the topics with the top 3-4 highest votes. Starting with the topic with the highest votes.\n5. After 5(?) minutes, we all decide if we'd like to continue or move on to the next topic.\n6. If we continue, after 15(?) minutes, we all move on to the next topic of discussion.\n7. At 7pm, we wrap up and officially end. Before everyone leaves, we vote on the next restaurant that we'll meet at.\n\nThis is [inspired by Lean Coffee](https://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/), and intended for participants to be collaborators in the conversation focused on AppSec & ProdSec topics.\nFor the location selection, here are the considerations we work with:\n\n1. It must be within 1 \"city block\" of the Melbourne Free Tram Zone.\n2. The typical price for a whole meal (without alcohol) should be under $50 per person.\n3. It must allow individual orders - you'd be ordering and paying for your own meal.\n4. It will need to have seating space for the group to say, just walk-in to the restaurant ( this may change if it grows beyond 10 regular attendees ).\n5. It must be quiet enough for us to have meaningful conversations.\n6. It must not be a restaurant we've been to in the past 6 months. (Just to keep things fresh )\n\nAlso, although we use the word \u201crestaurant\u201d this is used broadly to mean food establishment - if we\u2019re all keen on hitting up a decent kebab place, that works. As a courtesy to the venue, there's an expectation that you'd order something there.\n\nSee you there.\nThank you."

Anyone who is interested and enthusiastic about application security or security in general is welcome. All meetings are free and open. You do not have to be an OWASP member.\n\nThere will also be plenty of time to socialize before and after the event.\n\n_What are we going to talk about?\n\n**1\\. Talk:** **Security at Scale - Mastering Cloud Security in the Cyberwar Era**\n\n*Dominik Sowinski, Cybersecurity Architect & Cybersecurity Community Lead, Siemens*\n\nIn the midst of rapid cloud transformation, industrial organisations face an ever-evolving cyber threat landscape, exacerbated by global events such as the war in Ukraine. This presentation will address the latest APT activities and the significant risks they pose to cloud infrastructures and critical industrial operations. We will explore cutting-edge strategies, technical considerations and essential processes to rapidly adapt and secure cloud environments at scale against these relentless threats. The presentation will help you understand how to fortify cloud applications and infrastructure in this dynamic threat landscape.\n\n**2\\. Talk: Let's talk vulnerabilities**\n\n*Vinit K., Independent security research and threat hunting*\n\nA talk and live demo on cybersecurity threats involving terminal emulators and SSH.
