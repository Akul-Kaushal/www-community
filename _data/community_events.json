The talks start at **6:30pm** (we start on time).\n\n**TALKS**\n\n**OWASP Introduction, Welcome and News** \\- Sam Stepanyan\\, Sherif Mansour and Andra Lezza\n\nWelcome and a brief update on OWASP Projects & upcoming OWASP Conferences from the OWASP London Chapter Leaders\n\n**\"Go Hack Yourself: API Hacking for Beginners\"** \\- Dr Katie Paxton\nOver the past few years, we've really seen API hacking take off as a field of its own, diverging from typical web app security, but yet parallel to it. Often we point to the amorphous blob that is web security and go: \"here you go, now you can be a hacker too\", with top 10 lists, write-ups, conference talks and whitepapers smiling as we do. This creates a major challenge for developers who want to test their APIs for security or just people who want to get into API hacking, how on earth do you wade through all the general web security to get to the meat of API hacking, what do you even need to know?\nThis talk is going to break down API hacking from a developer point of view, teaching you everything you need to know about API hacking, from the bugs you can find and to the impact you can cause, to how you can easily test your own work or review your peers.\n\n**\"Maturing Your Application Security Program\"** \\- Tanya Janca\nAfter working with over 300 companies on their application security programs the most common question I receive is \u201cwhat\u2019s next?\u201d. They want to know how to mature their programs, and when they look at the maturity models available, they find them intimidating and so far beyond their current maturity level that they feel impossible. In this talk I will take you through 3 common AppSec program maturity levels I have encountered over the years, with practical and actionable next steps you could take immediately to improve your security posture.\n\n**SPEAKERS**\n\n**Dr Katie Paxton-Fear ([@insiderPhD](https://x.com/@insiderPhD))**\nDr Katie Paxton-Fear is an API hacker and content creator at Traceable. She has a PhD in cyber security and artificial intelligence, but if you know her it\u2019s not for her academic work.\nShe\u2019s a hacker and YouTuber who's found bugs in over 30 companies. She wants to show that anyone can be a hacker, and share her passion and knowledge with others. She has hacked everything from the military to social media, reporting her findings promptly and making sure the attackers don't get their first! In her free time she makes videos, teaching her audience of 80k+ how to get into ethical hacking. You can\nfind her all over the internet as InsiderPhD.\n\n**Tanya Janca ([@shehackspurple](https://twitter.com/shehackspurple))**\nTanya Janca, also known as SheHacksPurple, is the best-selling author of \u2018Alice and Bob Learn Application Security\u2019. She is also the founder of \"We Hack Purple\", an online learning community that revolves around teaching everyone to create secure software. Tanya has been coding and working in IT for over twenty five years, won countless awards, and has been everywhere from public service to tech giants, writing software, leading communities, founding companies and \u2018securing all the things\u2019. She is an award-winning public speaker, active blogger & podcaster and has delivered hundreds of talks on 6 continents. Tanya values diversity, inclusion, and kindness, which shines through in her countless initiatives.

Please note that you MUST book your place to be admitted to the event by the building security - your name will be checked against the guest list.\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

He will share why engaging with development and business teams is essential for the Shift Left journey.\n\n***II. Cultivating Developer Adoption in the era of Artificial Intelligence-Snyk***\nIn today\u2019s fast-paced, AI-driven development landscape, securing developer adoption is key to integrating security seamlessly into workflows. This presentation explores practical strategies to overcome challenges like trust, tooling complexity, and unclear ownership. By focusing on people, processes, and tools, we demonstrate how to empower developers, reduce friction, and scale security effectively. Attendees will gain actionable insights to foster a collaborative culture where security becomes a natural part of development.\nOne of the biggest challenges that organizations face when shifting left is getting developers to actually adopt the \u201cshift left\" tools. This presentation speaks to how to overcome that.\n\n***III.*** **Development Team Transformation -Contrast Security**\nThe lines between proactive and reactive cyber defenses are somewhat arbitrary. If you blur those lines, you can some serious advantages. A SAST or SCA tool finding is a theoretical vulnerability that may or may not be exploitable, but if you can see that a vulnerability is within the blast radius of active probes or attacks, it suddenly becomes real. What might have been labeled as \"critical\" in pre-prod suddenly becomes \"super-critical\". On the other hand, things that are not exploitable in a production context due to compensating control, can be deprioritized preserving the limited attention of development for things that really matter. Join DevSecOps pioneer, Larry Maccherone, for this thought-provoking discussion on going right to shift left"
