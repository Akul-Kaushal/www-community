Explore the tangible impact of AI-generated code in this session buy playing with fire - Using GPT-driven prompts, we'll build a fully functional application, and in real time, we'll uncover how common security flaws like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and weak authentication can manifest in AI-generated code.\n\nThrough hands-on exploration, we'll walk through the potential impact of these vulnerabilities and how these risks could be avoided with secure coding practices, defined policies, developer guardrails, and thorough security audits and code review.\n\nBy the end of the session, you'll have a deep understanding of how to:\n\n* Recognize and assess the risks AI introduces in your code.\n* Implement secure coding practices and enforce security policies.\n* Integrate security audits, code reviews, and testing into your development workflow to ensure AI-generated code is safe for production.\n\nThis session is vendor agnostic and designed to empower you to reap the benefits of AI without sacrificing security."

Startups move fast, but as you scale, customers demand trust, compliance becomes mandatory, and security debt turns into real risk.\n\nThis is real talk from the trenches - we\u2019ll share exactly how we evolved our security program from one built around reactive chaos to proactive resilience. If you\u2019re scaling fast, these lessons will help you move fast - without breaking trust.\n\n**Greg Sienkiewicz** is a DevSecOps engineer at Rewind, an Ottawa-based scale-up focused on protecting SaaS and cloud data. He holds multiple industry certifications, including ISC2 Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP) and AWS Certified Security - Specialty. He is a long-time supporter of OWASP - holds a Lifetime Membership - and is actively involved in the Ottawa chapter."
