But while there are several commonly used prioritization inputs that can help manage CVE noise \u2014 like CVSS, EPSS, and KEV \u2014 there are additional factors organizations would be wise to consider beyond these frameworks.\nThis talk will provide guidance for using inputs like asset business context, remediation efficiency, and exploitability analysis alongside traditional vulnerability metrics. Additionally, it will cover important outputs (like VEX and VDR statements) that efficient vulnerability management programs can use to communicate outcomes and posture to internal and external audiences.\n\nEvent sponsored by FOSSA: https://fossa.com/\nDinner provided\nPlease arrive on-time as we begin promptly at 5:30."

NI has been on a journey over the last several years to improve the security of its products driven by customer requirements, their expectations, and increasingly, regulations that require software to be developed with secure methodologies.

This comprehensive framework offers a structured approach to prioritizing and implementing security measures within DevOps practices.\n\nIn this workshop, Timo will introduce DSOMM and its practical application, demonstrating how to leverage DevOps strategies to enhance security. He'll showcase the DSOMM application and its features, guiding you through the process of customizing and scaling your AppSec program. Specifically, how you can customize the activities your team(s) should implement with level, title, descriptions/requirements, and evidence to deliver it to your teams including the current implementation status.\nYou'll learn about the \"inheritance\" concept in DSOMM activities and its time-saving benefits, including automatic mapping to frameworks like SAMM and ISO 27001. Through an interactive exercise, you'll create a small application security testing program based on DSOMM, gaining hands-on experience in prioritizing AppSec activities.\n\nThis talk offers tools and techniques for all skill levels, whether you're new to AppSec/DevSecOps or looking to refine your existing strategies.\nJoin us to learn how DSOMM can transform your approach to security and sharpen your skills in prioritizing AppSec/DevSecOps activities for enhancing impact.\n\n*Requirements*:\n\\- Docker\n\\- Linux is recommended\\.\n\n**SPONSORSHIP Opportunities Available**\n*Vendors interested in sponsoring please send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

He will have a talk about OAuth security and then we will discuss bright and dark sides of bug bounty.\n\nAgenda:\n\n1. **OAuth Secrets (Grzegorz Niedziela)**\nThese days, Oauth is a key protocol, allowing us to log in with one click to many websites. As anything, this convenience doesn\u2019t come without a cost. The cost here is the risk of an account takeover bug. And that\u2019s not only changing the redirect_uri to an attacker-controlled host which, for many hackers, is the only attack they know. That attack won't work too well in 2024. This talk will be about exploiting smaller misconfigurations. For example, what do to if you only control the path of the redirect_uri or how to exfiltrate the code when your open doesn't preserve parameters. It will also focus on particular auth providers and how they don't make it hard for us by being way more relaxed than the standard defines.\n2. After the break, we will be hosting a **discussion about bug boutnty**. We want to discuss both sides - bug bounters and companies which have bug bounty programs.\nHow to report vulnerabilities? Where to seek? What should be your goal - easy bugs occuring en masse or sophisticated kill-chains? What to expect? Bug bounty myths and reality.\nHow bug bounty might help your organisation? What are the real costs of having bb program? What can go wrong? How to manage good bb program? Bug bounty or penetration testing?\n\nPlease RSVP and save the date!\nIf you have a minute, **please share this invitation** with friends and in your social media."

From hacking computers for fun in his early days to co-founding Escape as CTO, Antoine graduated from top-notch schools: Ecole Polytechnique (Paris) and UC Berkeley (California), before working at Apple as a Machine Learning Engineer. Antoine is also a recognized figure in the tech industry, sharing his knowledge by speaking at major international conferences such as the InCyber Forum, bSides, APIdays, and the GraphQL Conference.\n\nTopic: \u201cGraphQL Vulnerabilities in the Wild: A Hands-On Workshop with OWASP TOP 10 Insights\u201d\n\nABSTRACT:\n\nJoin Antoine Carossio, Co-founder & CTO of Escape, the leading Application Security Testing startup, for an immersive, hands-on workshop focused on the OWASP TOP 10 and GraphQL vulnerabilities. This session provides a rare opportunity to engage directly with the cutting-edge challenges and solutions in the ever-evolving world of GraphQL security.\n\nDrawing on extensive research into real-world production GraphQL endpoints, Antoine will guide you through the complex security landscape of GraphQL. With his deep expertise in offensive security, Antoine will share valuable insights and proactive strategies to tackle today\u2019s most critical vulnerabilities.\n\nAntoine and his team have invested over 500 hours in chaos engineering across more than 1500 GraphQL endpoints, uncovering over 46,000 security flaws, including critical vulnerabilities that expose sensitive data without authentication. In this hands-on workshop, you\u2019ll dive deep into these findings and learn the tools and methodologies needed to secure your own GraphQL implementations.\n\nThe session will explore the OWASP TOP 10 vulnerabilities and how they intersect with GraphQL\u2019s unique security challenges. From complexity issues and schema leaks to traditional API security flaws like injections and internal server errors, you\u2019ll gain a comprehensive understanding of potential threats. Real-world case studies will illustrate the severe impact of data leaks, including personal information, secrets, and tokens.\n\nYou\u2019ll leave the workshop equipped with practical skills and tools, including GraphQL Armor and a detailed security checklist, to help you proactively safeguard your GraphQL applications. This session is crucial for developers, security professionals, and SREs who want to confidently navigate the intricate waters of GraphQL security."
