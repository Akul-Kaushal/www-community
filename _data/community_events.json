This presentation proposes a unified language for AppSec, balancing development and security priorities. It emphasizes understanding open-source usage, risks in tooling practices, and contextualizing vulnerabilities. Join us to align security with development goals, fostering rapid innovation while ensuring security.\n\nThomas Gleason is an AppSec enthusiast who enjoys building teams and tools to enhance security. He has hands-on experience with the pros and cons of DevSecOps. Outside of work, he cherishes his Rhode Island home and has a penchant for a well-cooked risotto. His professional expertise and personal interests make him a well-rounded individual in the field."

One way for organizations to combat this growing threat is to empower their red teams to test the software supply chains for that organization. But many red teams are ill-prepared to tackle this new attack surface.\n\nThis talk will have three distinct parts:\n\n1\\. I will describe how security teams\\, red teams\\, or security researchers can quickly identify the multiple components in a particular applications software supply chain\\, and then how to find soft targets to focus on\\.\n2\\. I will describe my VBP framework \\(value\\, behaviour and patterns\\) which is an applied threat modelling framework for software supply chains\\.\n3\\.

This is especially true since most vulnerabilities aren\u2019t actually exploitable in their real-world context, and wasting time on non-exploitable issues can get in the way of remediating the most impactful vulnerabilities.\nThis talk will explore strategies to mitigate CVE overload and streamline the vulnerability resolution process. In addition to exploring complexities around CVE noise \u2014 such as the difficulty in distinguishing between high-risk, low-risk, and no-risk vulnerabilities and the pressure to maintain business continuity while ensuring robust security \u2014 we\u2019ll analyze five specific vulnerability prioritization inputs:\n\n1. CVSS scores\n2. EPSS scores\n3. VEX\n4. The CISA KEV Catalog\n5. Reachability analysis\n\nAdditionally, the talk will cover the role of automation and tooling to prioritize vulnerabilities at scale as well as recommended workflows between IT, security teams, and business units to ensure comprehensive risk management.\n\n**Thanks to our Sponsor**: *[FOSSA](https://fossa.com/)*\n*FOSSA is a leading application security and compliance platform that specializes in helping engineering teams deliver trusted software. FOSSA enables companies to prioritize real vulnerabilities in their open source dependencies with comprehensive SCA (software composition analysis) capabilities, while also making it possible for organizations to automate compliance reporting and SBOM (software bill of materials) lifecycle management to meet customer and regulatory requirements. Founded in 2015, FOSSA is trusted by thousands of global organizations, has been downloaded nearly two million times, and has conducted nearly 100 million open-source scans.*\n\n**SPONSORSHIP Opportunities Available**\n*Vendors interested in sponsoring please send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

        "description": "How do you define the scope of penetration testing for a web application project? Is it the OWASP Top Ten, formal guidelines established by organizations such as NIST, security stories developed by the product owner and the security team, or recommendations made by your development team? The answer is all the above depending on the client, your development environment, and your capacity to take the risk.\n\nThis presentation will share experiences gained from penetration testing of a web application hosted by a Government agency providing professional licenses to its prospective clients. The nature of the project touched numerous areas such as CJIS (Criminal Justice Information Service), Personal Identifiable Information (PII), Access Control (Authorization in particular), and adherence to the security standard\u2019s office guidelines. The challenge was to identify and prioritize the test suite that will cover these specific areas in a constrained time period. To enhance the coverage, the test suite had to include DAST (using ZAP) and some specific general scenarios.\n\nThe audience will take away some approaches that when applied can lead to a well balanced (both effective and efficient) penetration testing.\n\nSCHEDULE\nDoors open at 5:30. The talk will begin about 6pm.\n\nENTRY\nThere are doors on Washington and Broadway. Both of them auto-lock at 6pm. From 6 to 6:15pm, only the door on Broadway will be available. Take the elevator to the 11th floor.\n\nNO ENTRY AFTER 6:15 PM\nIt will not be possible to enter the building after 6:15.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nOur host again this month is NedSpace, a co-working space in downtown Portland--a friendly place to work when you don't want to work from home.\n\nFOOD\nWe don't yet have a sponsor for July, so there may not be food this time.

The tool is similar to other test tools like AWS CloudGoat, CloudFoxable, AzureGoat, GCPGoat, and Pen-Testing Cloud REST APIs in OpenStack. It is not, however, a tool for attacking [Salesforce.com](http://salesforce.com/) itself. It is novel because it focuses on custom applications deployed using the Salesforce platform and is the first tool to provide lab exercises with a collection of security tests.

We remotely reprogrammed the OPS-SAT's onboard FPGA with our custom cores, adding a Hardware Security Module (HSM) and a RISC-V processor. We then developed an application that captured a satellite image, processed it on the RISC-V, encrypted it on the HSM, and sent it to our ground office. There, we decrypted the image using the appropriate key and displayed it, ensuring secure data transmission.\n\nThe second use-case is an ongoing project to create an encrypted satellite communication link. This involves integrating our HSM/FPGA with an Iridium modem using the Short Burst Data (SBD) service. This setup enables us to send end-to-end hardware-encrypted messages worldwide, ensuring secure and reliable communication.\n\nThese examples demonstrate our work in enhancing secure satellite communications through advanced encryption and processing technologies.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\n**Jelizaveta Vakarjuk** is a junior researcher in Cybernetica and industrial PhD student at Tallinn University of Technology. Her research focuses on post-quantum cryptography, privacy-preserving cryptography, and security of voting systems. Mainly she studies post-quantum digital signatures, but also focuses on the aspects of migration to post-quantum cryptography.\n\n Speech: **Obstacles of migration to post-quantum cryptography**\n\nWith the rising development of quantum technologies there is an urgent need to secure existing IT infrastructure against quantum threats. Introducing post-quantum cryptography to present systems could protect them against future quantum computer attacks. Still, post-quantum migration is a challenging process which requires systematic planning and years of execution. In this talk, I will share what are the main migration obstacles in example of Estonian e-services.\n\n **And That's Not All - More Surprises Await!** Whether you're a cybersecurity professional, a tech enthusiast, or just curious about cryptography, there's something for everyone!\n\n **Connect, Collaborate, and Create:** This event is more than just talks - it's a platform to connect with like-minded folks!\n\n **Mark Your Calendars:**\nThursday 04th July at 18:30 - 20:30\nWorkland Maakri 19\n\n **Limited seats, registration on Meetup required!** "
