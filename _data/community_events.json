        "description": "In just a short span, AI Agents and low-code development have transformed how businesses operate, allowing users without coding backgrounds to create applications, automate processes, and streamline workflows. Business users are empowered as never before, using tools that merge AI with productivity\u2014from email and business intelligence to application development. But while these tools amplify efficiency, they also introduce new security risks that challenge the traditional boundaries of IT and AppSec.\n\nAs security teams grapple with vulnerabilities like authorization misuse, data leakage, and the risk of exfiltration, they must decide how to approach the widespread adoption of AI-driven tools and low-code platforms without stifling innovation. In this session, we\u2019ll explore recent research into the security challenges posed by AI agents and low-code development, emphasizing the pitfalls that emerge when business users become app creators. We\u2019ll also outline how AppSec teams can adapt their approaches to balance security with productivity, ensuring they enable the business rather than block it."

Security teams are often overwhelmed by alerts, many of which pose no real threat. Enter reachability analysis\u2014a transformative approach to vulnerability prioritization that filters out noise and highlights exploitable vulnerabilities.\n\nThis talk demystifies reachability analysis and its five key types, explaining how this methodology helps streamline vulnerability management in modern software ecosystems.\n\nWe\u2019ll address the confusion around reachability techniques and explore how they interact to deliver a more focused, actionable security strategy.\n\nKey Discussion Points:\n\n1\\. What Is Reachability Analysis in ASPM?\n\u2022 Understanding the concept of reachability: determining whether vulnerabilities are actually exploitable in runtime environments.\n\u2022 The role of reachability in Application Security Posture Management (ASPM): filtering irrelevant issues and reducing vulnerability overload.\n\n2\\. The Five Types of Reachability Analysis:\n\u2022 Code Reachability Analysis: Identifying if vulnerable code paths are executed during runtime.\n\u2022 Library Reachability Analysis: Assessing whether third-party libraries\u2019 vulnerabilities are actively used in application execution.\n\u2022 Container Reachability Analysis: Determining whether vulnerable packages in containerized environments are executed during runtime.\n\u2022 Static Reachability Analysis: Analyzing vulnerabilities in the codebase and loaded libraries without runtime execution.\n\u2022 Runtime Reachability Analysis: Focusing on vulnerabilities actively being executed in the live environment\n\n3\\. Challenges in Implementing Reachability Analysis:\n\u2022 Complexity in integrating reachability across diverse environments.\n\u2022 Lack of visibility into dynamic and containerized deployments.\n\u2022 Overcoming the limitations of traditional CWE classifications and addressing their practical gaps.\n\n4\\. Leveraging Context and AI for Effective Vulnerability Management:\n\u2022 Using contextual deduplication to reduce noise by merging duplicate vulnerabilities across code, containers, and environments.\n\u2022 Incorporating cyber threat intelligence to prioritize exploitable vulnerabilities in real-world scenarios.\n\u2022 How AI-driven analysis identifies patterns and generates actionable insights for remediation. Takeaways for Attendees:\n\u2022 Gain a clear understanding of reachability analysis and its role in reducing vulnerability overload.\n\u2022 Learn how to implement and prioritize vulnerabilities using contextual deduplication and threat intelligence.\n\u2022 Explore how static and runtime reachability analysis complement each other for a comprehensive approach.\n\u2022 Discover practical applications of reachability analysis in modern ASPM solutions to improve security team efficiency.\n\nThis talk offers a roadmap for security teams looking to harness the power of reachability analysis to focus on what truly matters. By bridging the gap between overwhelming alerts and actionable insights, you can redefine your vulnerability management strategy and build a stronger, more resilient security posture."

How WebPKI is Failing Users** (75 minutes)\n\n* For decades, WebPKI has relied on certificate revocation as a safety net to shield users from untrusted websites.\n* The issue is that our current approaches: CRLSet and OCSP, don't fully address the issue and have glaring weaknesses.\n* CRLite was born from Mozilla to challenge the status quo and make certificate revocation a reality.\n* But what lies behind CRLite's success? A fascinating journey through the realms of cryptography and hashing reveals that the solution is rooted in an unlikely place: a 50-year-old mathematical concept.\n* The answer may surprise you, but it's one that could change everything."

As a result, most smartphones are locked when distributed, and anti-reversing techniques are widely used. Consequently, millions of users use smartphones daily without a clear understanding of the software\u2019s functionality and purpose. To lower the bar for security researcher to analyze Android firmware, we developed a novel framework, called FirmwareDroid. In this talk, we discuss the challenges to automate the process of analyzing Android firmware and showcase how we use FirmwareDroid to analyse pre-installed Android apps in academia.\n* **Continuous Security with DevSecOps - by Romano Roth:** Security must be seamlessly integrated into every stage of the software development lifecycle. This talk explores how combining DevSecOps principles with Platform Engineering empowers teams through automation, standardized environments, and reduced complexity. Learn how these approaches transform application security into a proactive, scalable, and collaborative enabler for delivering secure, high-quality software at speed."
