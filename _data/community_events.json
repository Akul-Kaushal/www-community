In fact there are many: ethical hackers learning and testing their skills, not-so-ethical hackers looking for targets, researchers demonstrating new offensive techniques, plus a lot of legal implications too.\nWe'll go behind the scenes at the network and security operations centres for the Black Hat conferences worldwide, to share more details, stories and plain-text credentials.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you there!\n\nBest regards,\n\nJim + Nathe\nOWASP Birmingham Chapter Leaders"

That adds up to increased business risk for a lot of companies and fuels an urgent need to improve application security strategies. But how?\nThe key is to move from a compliance-based approach to managing application risk.\nJoin us for an in-depth discussion of what it takes to stop playing defense when it comes to application security. He'll wrangle over topics like:\n\n* The tell-tale signs of reactive mode\n* The value of preventative best practices\n* How to build security actions into the developer experience\n* The need for a holistic view and effective prioritization\n* Arming the security team with instant control at scale"

The talks start at 6:30pm (we start on time!).\n\n**TALKS:**\n\n**OWASP Introduction, Welcome and News** \\- Sam Stepanyan\\, Andra Lezza\\, Sherif Mansour \\- OWASP London Chapter Leaders\n\n**\"Security by Design, Not Injection\"** \u2013 Trevor Young\n\nSecurity by Design encompasses a variety of processes and technologies aimed at embedding security and compliance early in the development lifecycle. We know adopting Security by Design culture and processes can lower risk by preventing vulnerabilities in software, however effectively educating and shifting teams to implement these changes is notoriously difficult. It is a paradigm shift for most organizations, and many of them fail on their first attempt before finding\nsomething that works for them. This discussion will highlight how to explain what Security by Design is and will present strategies for communicating the importance and value it delivers.\n\n**\"OWASP Depscan v6 - The SCA Tool For Agile Builders, Creators, And Doers\"** \\- Prabhu Subramanian\n\nMost SCA tools can be best described as simple SBOM scanners with a backing vulnerability database. This naive design can lead to numerous false positive alerts due to a lack of comprehensive context. To accurately assess an application's security posture, it's crucial to consider its entire lifecycle, from pre-build to post-build, and capture the full-stack information in the form of SBOM, SaaSBOM, CBOM, OBOM etc.\nOWASP depscan v6 is a groundbreaking SCA tool that addresses these limitations by leveraging full-stack information. This innovative approach enables more precise vulnerability triage and prioritization, empowering developers to take informed action.\nJoin us to meet the project leader behind depscan v6, explore live demos, and delve into the technical intricacies of an xBOM-based SCA tool.\n\n**Guest Talk: TBC**\n\n**RAFFLE - win a prize kindly donated by our sponsors!**\n\n**SPEAKERS:**\n\n**Trevor Young**\n\nTrevor Young is an entrepreneurial product and technology leader who stays on top of the latest in design, architecture, and creative technologies. Having founded and led companies providing digital offerings, he uncovered his passion for collaborative problem solving, and innovation.He excels at finding inefficiencies in digital markets and disrupting them.\nTrevor combines strategic leadership with technical ability, formed from experience in a broad background of practical applications. Trevor currently serves as Chief Product Officer at Security Compass, where heleads product strategy for the company's Secure by Design platform, and Application Security Training library.\n\n**Prabhu Subramanian (@_prbh)**\n\nPrabhu Subramanian is a distinguished security expert and active contributor to the open-source security community. Prabhu is the author and OWASP Leader behind projects such as OWASP CycloneDX Generator (cdxgen) and OWASP depscan. He specializes in Supply Chain Security and offers consultancy to global clients via his company, AppThreat Ltd.\n\n**TICKETS:**\n\nOWASP meetups are free and open to anyone interested in application security.

I will try to explain key quantum concepts like superposition and entanglement, contrasting them with classical computing principles.\n\nI will address security concerns by discussing the vulnerability of current cryptographic algorithms and infrastructure to quantum attacks. A brief history of cryptography and solutions to the challenges from quantum computing. Then we will outline ongoing efforts to develop quantum-resistant cryptography and the standardization processes from organizations such as NIST.\n\nOpportunities for adoption of post-quantum computing safe algorithms exist today and can be planned for and budgeted. Education and awareness will be crucial, ensuring stakeholders understand the implications of quantum computing on cybersecurity.\n\nBy the end of the presentation, attendees will gain a foundational understanding of quantum computing's impact on security and practical steps to protect sensitive data in a quantum-enabled future.\n\nWe're always looking for presenters and topics for future meetings - contact John (john.dileo@owasp.org) if you have an idea for a topic, or a presentation you'd like to make. That way, it won't always be John talking about what he's been working on recently.\n\nThe Auckland-area OWASP Meetup usually takes place on the third Tuesdays of March, May, July, September, and November. There is no Meetup in January, as our members enjoy their holidays."

This talk will walk attendees through each item on the 2021 list, from broken access control to server-side request forgery. Each vulnerability is explored in detail\u2014understanding how it works, why it\u2019s dangerous, and what\u2019s needed to prevent it. With real examples to bring these threats to life, this session is an accessible introduction for beginners and a useful refresher for seasoned practitioners.\nJoin us to get a solid foundation in web security essentials.\n\n*DevSecOps Worst Practices with Tanya Janca.*\nQuite often when we read best practices we are told \u2018what\u2019 to do, but not the \u2018why\u2019. When we are told to ensure there are no false positives in the pipeline, the reason seems obvious, but not every part of DevOps is that intuitive, and not all \u2018best practices\u2019 make sense on first blush. Let\u2019s explore tried, tested, and failed methods, and then flip them on their head, so we know not only what to do to avoid them, but also why it is important to do so, with these DevSecOps WORST practices.\n\n**Speakers:**\n**Gabriel Kronfeld** is a graduate from the University of Ottawa with a degree in Computer Engineering. With experience spanning backend programming, DevOps, system administration, and database management, Gabriel has collaborated with various Ottawa-based companies on technical projects. Although new to cybersecurity, he brings a strong technical foundation and is keen to expand his knowledge in this field. Outside of work, Gabriel enjoys cycling, photography, and building drones as hands-on hobbies.\n\n**Tanya Janca**, aka SheHacksPurple, is the best-selling author of 'Alice and Bob Learn Secure Coding', 'Alice and Bob Learn Application Security\u2019 and \u2018Cards Against AppSec'. Over her 28-year IT career she has won countless awards (including OWASP Lifetime Distinguished Member and Hacker of the Year), spoken all over the planet, and is a prolific blogger. Tanya has trained thousands of software developers and IT security professionals, via her online academies (We Hack Purple and Semgrep Academy), and her live training programs. Having performed counter-terrorism, led security for the 52nd Canadian general election, developed or secured countless applications, Tanya Janca is widely considered an international authority on the security of software. Tanya currently leads education and community for Semgrep."

Thanks to that, we are able to detect potential problems at the beginning and avoid a lot of changes on the advanced maturity of the product.\nThe goal of this presentation is to compare the most well-known Threat\nModeling methodologies, their strong and weak sides. Based on our knowledge, we will compare these methods with the process and tools that are used in our company, and share our experience based on the work with development teams.\n2. After the break, we will host a **discussion about threat modeling**. Share our experiences with TM. When it's applicable. How to start doing TM in your project?

However, recent changes in Java have rendered many known exploits and attack patterns ineffective in newer versions. This talk will provide an overview of these changes and discuss which techniques are still viable. Additionally, we will discuss how to harden existing Java applications that run on current Java versions.\n\n**Agenda (Subject to Change):**\n\n* **6:00 PM**: Arrival\n* **6:30 PM - 7:30 PM**: Presentation\n* **7:30 PM - approximately 9:00 PM**: Barbecue, drinks, discussion, and networking"
