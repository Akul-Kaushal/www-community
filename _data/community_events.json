Join us as we discuss vulnerabilities identified in [points.com](http://points.com/) and other pieces of airline infrastructure which lead to mass PII disclosure, an infinite money glitch, and free upgrades.\n\n**Talk #2 -** Secrets from a bygone era by **Dylan Ayrey**\nGitHub is a platform that was designed for sharing, it wasn't designed for unsharing. So how difficult does it become to unshare? This talk will dig into all the different ways your secrets might get replicated, propagated, persisted, and shared, for decades following your mistake.\n\n**Talk#3** The Internet is broken, Putting IPv6 into perspective\n**Description**:\nMost of the Internet is currently running on a legacy version of the Internet Protocol: IPv4. Despite of this, the number of engineers, especially in security, who know how to use IPv6 is relatively low. In this talk, previously presented internally at NCC Group, I will show you why today's Internet does not live up to its original vision, take you back to the past to show you what the IPv4 Internet used to look like and through this reveal the secrets that will make you understand IPv6.\n\n**Speaker**:**Denis Smajlovi\u0107,** Founding Security Consultant at Nova Information Security. With a background in security consulting having worked for some of the largest financial institutions in Scandinavia and biggest tech companies in the Bay Area, I started Nova to provide web application and network pentesting services with the idea that we are able to work closer with clients and provide greater value."

One more may come, so hold on to your hats!\nSo far we have:\n\n* An Intro to OSINTer\n* Tracking down the killer (with OSINT)\n\nHere's a brief synopis:\n\n**OSINTer**\n*Synopsis*\nOSINTer is a new, digital platform tailored towards breezing through the complexities involved in extracting strategic cyber threat intelligence from news about cyber threats. Designed to streamline the traditionally laborious process of manually tracing and compiling data, OSINTer offers an automated, efficient means of identification, collection, and tracking of the ever moving cyberthreat landscape. At this workshop we will delve into the platform's journey from a spark of an idea to a robust platform, currently serving 30.000 monthly users, and go over how you can integrate it into your daily work, helping you stay on top of the constant inflow of information.\n\n*Speaker bio*\nBertram Madsen and David Clayton co-conspirators in the realm of cybersecurity, with each specializing in different facets of the industry to combat digital threats effectively. Bertram, a proficient full-stack software developer, emphasizes open-source development and community collaboration, manifesting in the creation of a range of cybersecurity solutions. Most notably, he's responsible for the development of OSINTer, a digital platform designed to ease collection of strategic cyber threat intelligence (CTI), and in collaboration with David, they are attempting to rethink how we do CTI. David is an established leader within Denmark's cybersecurity landscape, with a breadth of experience spanning various critical infrastructure sectors, financial security and strategic leadership roles. He's renowned for championing the SagaLabs concept, gaining TF-CSIRT certification for his team, and providing exceptional insights as one of only two official SIM3 auditors in Denmark.\n\n**Tracking down the killer**\n*Synopsis*\nIn the mid 1990\u2019s Rasmus Kierkegaard Kristiansen \u2013 suspected of killing and dismembering a business partner I Portugal \u2013 managed to escape and hide from authorities. After a longer period of intense investigation, the trail was considered cold.\nIn 2018, 25 years after the murder, the unsolved case was still bugging the leading investigator at the time. He teams up with a TV production company to give the investigation another shot. As a\nbase requirement for funding, Kristoffer Scavenius was tasked with making a probable case that the murderer was in fact still alive. After initial setbacks, Kristoffer was eventually able to make the\ncase that Rasmus Kierkegaard Kristiansen was still alive and well, living in Sao Paolo, Brazil.\nThe talk will discuss some of the OSINT approaches used in this investigation.\n\n*Speaker bio*\nKristoffer Scavenius has worked in OSINT since 2013 and has held positions as researcher/programmer in both government and the private sector."

Meeting this challenge is not just about building secure applications since we all know that rapid development of software as well as the evolution of threats and vulnerabilities can see our applications as secure today but vulnerable tomorrow. That is why having an established product security team and response capability is extremely important.\nDuring this discussion, I will discuss, using real-world examples, including that of my own, how organizations can meet the demands of product security including:\n\n* Building a culture of security within your organization beyond firewalls and anti-virus\n* How to \u201csell\u201d security to executive management and explaining what product security does and doesn\u2019t do (e.g., staffing, budgets, etc.)\n* Building and deploying software using the \"DevOps\" approach, while maintaining a high level of security\n* The difficulties of wearing multiple hats, with security being one of them Embedding \u201csecurity\u201d in the software development life cycle (SDLC)\n* Establishing a proper security \u201cresponse\u201d program Product vulnerability transparency and developing a disclosure policy How to measure the success of your program\n* Establishing a bug bounty program\n\n**THANKS to OUR SPONSOR**: *[DevOcean](https://www.devocean.security)*\n*DevOcean Cloud-First Remediation OS helps organizations cut the time, backlog and manual efforts required to close more issues, reduce MTTR and the attack surface. It is an API-based SaaS that connects the dots between cloud, code, security scanner and alert tools to consolidate and enrich remediation context with root cause analysis, owner identification, customized prioritization and tailored fix suggestions.*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone. Please reach out to one of our chapter leaders if you have any feedback/concerns or would like to speak to us, we take these matters very seriously.

Unfortunately, many organizations are moving quickly to adopt AI in development with little thought of security consequences. Threat modeling enable security analysts to understand the additional risks that development with LLMs represents. This session will provide an overview of AI and LLM security challenges and demonstrate how threat modeling can identify potential security weaknesses. Inspired by the OWASP Top 10 list for LLMs, the session will provide a threat modeling approach for LLMs that is straightforward to adopt in production.\n\n**NOTE: there will be door prize drawings for those that attend in person**"

However, evaluating the effectiveness of individual detections is often overlooked. In this presentation, we will delve into objective methods for assessing the quality of static analysis detections without incurring additional resources. We\u2019ll learn about how Microsoft\u2019s M365 Application Security team develops new detections and how they evaluate the effectiveness of those detections to ensure maximum impact at reducing security risk.\n\n**David Streat** is an experienced application security professional with almost 20 years in software development and application security. Having led Appsec teams at both EA and Microsoft, David has always strived to create solutions that improve code security where developers work. Plus, telling corny dad jokes doesn\u2019t hurt either."
