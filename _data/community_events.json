We\u2019ve dubbed this operation PROXYLIB. Other researchers identified this malicious behavior in a single free VPN application\u2014Oko VPN\u2014 which resulted in the app's removal from the Play Store. Based on further analysis of Oko VPN, Satori researchers uncovered 27 additional applications related to PROXYLIB. These apps shared a common native library, written in Golang, that enrolls the device as a proxy node. This talk will provide a high-level overview of the PROXYLIB Android malware and take the listener through the changes we observed in response to defenders\u2019 actions.\n\nLindsay Kaye is the Vice President of Threat Intelligence at HUMAN Security. Her technical specialty spans the fields of malware analysis and reverse engineering, with a keen interest in dissecting custom cryptographic systems. Lindsay is an internationally-recognized cybersecurity speaker and author.

        "description": "**Can we outsmart the adversaries? (Effective) Cyber Deception with Honeypots**\nIn today's ever-evolving cyber threat landscape, traditional defence mechanisms often struggle to keep pace with attacker ingenuity. Cyber deception offers a proactive approach, utilizing traps and deceiving tactics to lure attackers into controlled environments. Honeypots are one of the prominent techniques of cyber deception that act as decoy systems for capturing attacks and analyzing the adversary strategy. They provide an early detection mechanism as well as a method for learning how adversaries work and think. However, over the past years, several researchers have shown methods for fingerprinting honeypots. This significantly decreases the value of a honeypot; if an attacker can recognize the existence of such a system, they can evade it. This talk delves into the world of cyber deception, focusing on honeypots, their efficacy, and some fingerprinting techniques from my research. We'll explore how honeypots function and the contributions from The Honeynet Project, a non-profit, open-source community.\n**Speaker:** [Shreyas Srinivasa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreyas-srinivasa-ph-d-47038b13/overlay/contact-info/) is Cyber Security Specialist at TERMA Group, Co-founder of Selene CTI and previously Security Researcher at Aalborg University. He is contributor to the [Honeynet project](https://www.honeynet.org/), a non-profit dedicated to investigating the latest attacks and developing open source security tools to improve Internet security.\n\n**Information-Flow Security for the Working Software Engineer**\nHow does information flow through your software? Awareness of this gives you a new perspective when writing software with security requirements; it helps you avoid introducing information leaks into software, and gives you a conceptual framework for reasoning about software security in general.\nIn this talk, you will meet concepts like information leak, sources & sinks, dependencies, side\u2013channels, and flow policies. You will learn to identify information flows in software, to express application\u2013specific security requirements as flow policies, and to implement software that adheres to said flow policies.\nWant to try this out? Then bring a laptop; right after the talks, I will organize a little activity where you can tinker with \\`ifc-ts\\` - my TypeScript library for expressing flow policies. In \\`ifc-ts\\`, flow policy checks are reduced to checks performed by TypeScript's type checker. Thus, if your code type-checks, then your code is guaranteed to adhere to the flow policies expressed therein.\n\n**Speaker:** [Willard Rafnsson](https://www.willardthor.com/) is Associate Professor at the IT University of Copenhagen (ITU).

Whether through infiltrating the software delivery pipeline, deliberately uploading malicious components to popular repositories, or taking advantage of existing vulnerabilities in open source components, attackers are leveraging gaps in supply chain controls to compromise organizations. With GenAI quickly becoming a popular tool for developers to generate code, a new threat has emerged. AI package hallucinations is one of the more recent attack types within supply chain that is easy to execute and can have devastating effects. During this session we will give an overview of Supply Chain Security with some examples of the current threats, discuss AI package hallucinations, and preventative measures."

All problems will be based on real situations, with examples whenever possible. I will propose solutions for different teams' maturity levels, giving practical tips to start implementing security in the developers' pipeline.\n\nBio:\nTiago Mendo is a co-founder and CTO of Probely, a cybersecurity company that does web and API security scanning. With over 19 years of experience in the security field, he has extensive experience in pentesting applications, training, and providing all-around security consultancy.\nHolds a Master's in Information Security from Carnegie Mellon University and a CISSP certification. He is also a qualified member of AP2SI, a non-profit organization that promotes Information Security, and Co-Leader of the OWASP Lisboa Chapter, in Portugal.\nHe is also an international speaker at security conferences, such as SnowFROC, LASCON, BSides Krak\u00f3w, and BSides Lisbon.\n\nLinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiagomendo/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiagomendo/)\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nTitle: **Harnessing Reachability Analysis to Discern Real Threats in Software Dependencies**\n\nSpeaker: **Joseph Hejderup**\n\nAbstract:\nIn this talk, we will dive into the shortcomings of traditional dependency analysis methods, which usually focus on looking at build manifests and metadata, to spot security or performance vulnerabilities in Java projects. While tools like Maven Dependency Checker and Gradle's dependency-analysis plugin are invaluable for their ability to manage dependencies, they often fall short when we need quick and precise answers, forcing developers to lean on time-consuming tests and manual code reviews. We believe that a thorough look at how dependencies are actually used in the code\u2014with the help of static and reachability analyses\u2014can be a more effective way to pinpoint real threats in Java dependencies.\n\nWe'll use real-world examples to show how static analysis, and in particular reachability analysis, offers deeper insights into potential vulnerabilities by moving beyond simple metadata. By sharing examples where static analysis has been a game-changer, and pointing out where it might not be enough, we aim to shed light on the challenges and opportunities this method brings to improving security and performance in software projects.\n\nOur goal is to provide attendees with practical strategies for using static and reachability analyses, promoting a more detailed method for managing dependencies and finding vulnerabilities in software applications.\n\nBio:\nPart-time developer, part-time PhD student, full-time enthusiast in developing and researching techniques that makes package management system more intelligent and resilient against supply chain problems! Joseph Hejderup (Researcher/Software Engineer at Endor Labs & PhD student at Delft University of Technology) is applying program analysis techniques to better understand how we use third-party components and what risks third-party components entails from a security and maintenance perspective. Currently, he is applying years of research in Endor Labs with the mission to make dependency management a robust process that will empower developers, increase productivity, and solve security problems.\n\nLinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephhejderup/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephhejderup/)"

        "description": "EU is about to become a market leader in software cybersecurity regulation. With a large set of proposed and active laws, software development will be regulated like never before.\n\nWith the coming EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) all software and embedded systems will have to get a CE mark, which is now expanded to include cybersecurity aspects. It\u2019s going to be a huge change and will mean that the manufacturers (and in some cases importers) will get responsibility for the user\u2019s security and will have to provide free security patches for the lifetime of the product. Software developers will have to learn secure coding and the need for cyber security professionals will be very high.\n\nOne of the focus areas is vulnerability management. To keep a product secure during its lifetime, all 3rd party components will have to be monitored and up to date. At the heart of this process is the Software Bill of Materials, SBOM, which is used to monitor for known vulnerabilities in both Open Source and commercial components. The OWASP CycloneDX project fits right in and have been working with various kinds of bill-of-materials for a long time. CycloneDX is in the process of becoming an ECMA standard and thus fits better in to the EU regulation.\n\nIn this talk Olle E. Johansson will introduce the proposed EU CRA legislation and talk about the SBOM with a focus on the toolchain needed to manage vulnerabilities.\n\nWe will start the evening with a mingle at 17:30 followed by a presentation that will start at 18:00. The talk will be around 1 hour long followed by a further mingle/time for questions and answers.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nJoin OWASP Stockholm mailing list to get notified of upcoming events [https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/g/stockholm-chapter](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/g/stockholm-chapter)\nJoin our Slack channel on OWASP Slack *[#chapter-stockholm](https://owasp.slack.com/)*"

To ensure that mobile e-banking, door controls, health data, personal messages and photos are secure, mobile applications should also be developed securely. As the threat model for a mobile app can differ from other kinds of applications, frameworks such as the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) may not cover all the relevant IT security topics.\n* **Beyond the Top 10: Limits of a Finite Checklist**: In his talk, Marco will share insights from almost two decades of experience with the OWASP Top 10. He will discuss how this checklist has advanced web application security and brought critical issues to the forefront and also to the attention of non-technical people.\nMarco will provide real-world project anecdotes to highlight the limits of the Top 10, particularly in stakeholder communication. He will explore how broader resources like OWASP ASVS and SAMM provide additional guidance and fit into the bigger picture of establishing security practices.\nThe talk will conclude with an outlook on integrating practical checklists with detailed frameworks to enhance security strategies and stakeholder understanding. This session is a must for those seeking to bridge the gap between vulnerabilities and effective communication..\n* **Cloud Security**: More info coming soon\n* **Confidential Computing**: Encryption of data at rest and in transit are two well-established and generally advisable best practices for protecting IT environments. They can be implemented leveraging a plethora of tested and proven technologies such as disk encryption and network security. But what happens when data is processed, therefore not being at rest or in transit? At this point data becomes available in memory, usually in unencrypted to allow processing. This provides a window of opportunity for attackers to gain unallowed access to the data or perform various actions on it. Mitigating some of these attack vectors is what confidential computing aims to do. In this talk I will provide a brief overview over the concepts and outline use cases and limitations. There might after all be some caveats to it..."

With 14 years of enterprise experience and a lifelong passion for hacking\u2014now spanning two decades\u2014Daniel brings a wealth of expertise to the cybersecurity field. He still offers some Security Architectural consultancy for different companies across Europe, and from time to time, he engages in bounty hunting. When not decoding the matrix of cyber threats, Daniel enjoys life with his wife and two boys, plays football twice a week, and maintains a spirited sense of humor\u2014because in cybersecurity, sometimes, you really can't afford to joke.\n***\\~Securing the Gates: The Hidden Flaws Behind the Firewall\\~***\nEffective cybersecurity is not just about having defenses in place but ensuring they are properly designed. 'Securing the Gates: The Hidden Flaws Behind the Firewall' illuminates the common pitfalls in firewall implementations that often go unnoticed. This presentation will demonstrate typical design errors that compromise security and provide actionable insights on how to rectify these flaws to create robust defenses. Attendees will learn how to not only deploy but also optimize firewalls to safeguard their digital assets effectively.\n\n**Alina NICULA** - **VASP Lead and Product security assessment service owner and reviewer @Visma**. Alina has been working within product development teams as a software developer, security engineer, software and cloud service architect. In the last years she focused on software security by guiding Visma teams into securing their applications, data, cloud workloads, and delivery pipelines to avoid potential cybersecurity risks.\n***\\~Running a Product Security Assessment Program at scale\\~***\nHaving a product security assessment program is essential for any company. It is equally critical to ensure that this program remains relevant over the time and is scalable as the company grows.In this presentation, I will discuss how we ensure that our designed processes empower development teams to make informed security decisions while also giving them ownership over the remediation of the security aspects that impact their products.\nHowever, achieving this goal requires a strong and knowledgeable security review team that supports the delivery teams with informed security by design best practices.\nSo, how have we been able to grow our program? I hope you will leave this presentation with a clear understanding of our approach.\n\n**Adrian BARAN -** **Security Manager @ VITESCO**,\n\n***\\~ Contingency plan from security point of view \\~***\nAbstract:"
