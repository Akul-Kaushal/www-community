        "description": "**Overview:**\nOperational technology (OT) perimeters are rapidly emerging as a new frontier for attackers, mirroring the adversarial challenges seen in traditional IT boundaries. This talk explores crucial vulnerability classes and real-world exploitation tacticsaffecting common OT perimeter technologies. We will highlight significant risks and potential impacts of perimeter compromise on industrial environments. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the emerging threats at the OT boundary and the exploitation techniques adversaries may leverage.\n\n**Abstract:**\nAttacking IACS: Strategic Industrial Exploitation Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) underpin critical infrastructure worldwide but often rely on outdated security paradigms, which may leave them vulnerable to modern attacks. This presentation explores technical attack methodologies targeting IACS, contrasting them with traditional enterprise network exploitation techniques. Drawing on extensive experience in vulnerability research, exploit development, and red teaming, I will highlight the unique challenges and attacker opportunities presented by IACS environments\u2014such as reliance on legacy technologies, proprietary protocols, and stringent operational constraints.\n\nStructured around the IEC/TR 62443-3-1 standard, this presentation addresses critical gaps in modern security guidance for IACS environments. I will use examples to demonstrate strategic attack opportunities and illustrate how vulnerabilities are exploited differently within industrial settings compared to enterprise environments. Attendees will gain technical insights into the challenges of securing IACS against sophisticated attacks and leave with actionable defense strategies that address current IACS security gaps."

Great AppSec is really hard.\nOver almost 2 decades, Peter Chestna has consulted on and observed hundreds of AppSec programs. He's even built a few of my own. The similarities are striking and the impact and outcomes in these programs are stymied by common misconceptions about the goal of AppSec and the results we should be seeking.\n\nIn general, we find too much, fix too little, and do almost nothing to prevent new vulnerabilities. We have built a world where we attempt to report and goal our way to victory. How's that working for us? We need to rebalance our efforts across these three pillars and put the emphasis where it belongs. The accumulation of security debt is burying us all under a mountain of exception processing and annual recertification. Stop the madness!\n\nWhether you are a security leader or a development leader, Peter has practical guidance for you. In this presentation, Peter hopes to convince you that by shifting your current focus, you can drastically improve the results you get from your efforts.\n\nIn this talk, Peter will describe how to:\n1\\. Turn developers from adversaries to allies\\.\n2\\. Modify your controls to reflect reality and make compliance feel better\n3\\. Put the effort of your finite resources to places that will have the greatest impact\n4\\. Elevate your AppSec program to a level of excellence through effective developer engagement\n\n**Dinner Sponsorship: Brooksource**\n\n**Parking Information:** See picture below for parking and entrance information.\n\n**Evening Agenda:**\n5:30 \u2013 6:00 pm > Networking and Food (**in-person only**)\n6:00 \u2013 6:15 pm > Central Indiana ISSA Introduction and Chapter Business\n6:15 \u2013 7:30 pm > Meeting Speaker(s)\n7:30 \u2013 8:00 pm > Brooksource Social (Rooftop Bar) / Cleanup\n\n**Please note that the location for our chapter meetings is at Brooksource located at 6215 College Avenue, Indianapolis, IN 46220.**\n\n**PLEASE ARRIVE as close to 6:00 pm. as you can**\n\n![](https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F988552403%2F53386386960%2F1%2Foriginal.20250320-145032?h=740&w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&q=75&sharp=10&s=f5f6e341efbde307a59f5189215f5551)"

However, limitations such as \u201challucinations\u201d in which the model generates inaccurate or misleading outputs highlight the importance of human oversight in managing [risk posed by AI.](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nowsecure.com/blog/2024/11/13/the-ai-expansion-of-the-mobile-app-attack-surface-2/__;!!CiF3mHgEawk!GssNkv5CwozvfTaxygbQLi1ioHIc19CE3CvGKAs_O0ele9J9xXF2cotd_ExIbn2DT0uSktJ44pJhX1KU8Mtiq6eRnRAODGYNig$ \"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2024/11/13/the-ai-expansion-of-the-mobile-app-attack-surface-2/__;!!CiF3mHgEawk!GssNkv5CwozvfTaxygbQLi1ioHIc19CE3CvGKAs_O0ele9J9xXF2cotd_ExIbn2DT0uSktJ44pJhX1KU8Mtiq6eRnRAODGYNig$\")\nThis talk covers a novel approach for recovering application source code, leveraging AI language models to transform pseudo-disassembly into high-level source code. This method is able to handle complex abstractions introduced in high-level languages SwiftUI or Dart and generates output in popular programming languages like Swift, C#, Kotlin, Java, Python or even Bash.\n\n***II.* AI coding agents -Risks and Benefits-Endor Lab**\nThe proliferation of AI coding agents will accelerate the production of code, but what are the risks associated with this acceleration? In many ways the core challenge to securing these outputs will be the familiar fundamental challenges that appsec has always faced: maintaining an understanding of your inventory and risk-posture, conducting security assessments at scale, and managing processes for risk acceptance and remediation. Good appsec fundamentals will be critical in the new era of AI generated code. But coding agents also introduce novel concerns born from the inherent differences between these agents and human developers, as well the additional layers of abstraction which will become intrinsic to AI development: understanding how to vet and validate non-human agents, identifying the operational risks posed by agents trained on open-source, and the complexity of managing code developed through natural language will all require the development of new practices in appsec. This talk will look at some of the new risks that will arise in the era of large scale AI code development, and discuss possible paths forward for deploying such agents in a secure way.\n\n***III.*** **AppSec for AI AND NHI -GrayLog**\nAPPSEC FOR AI AND NHI - As we're empowering NHIs (**Non Human Identity**) to take on greater responsibilities, it's smart to wonder how we'll keep these good bots in bounds. This isn't possible to answer without acknowledging a dirty little secret -- while modern software is already driven by bots, modern security tools fall short in observing and regulating interactions between bots and APIs, whether those bots are trusted NHIs or malicious attackers. This session dispels a few myths about bots and bot detection and shows a few practical considerations and techniques to identify and block high-risk activities.\n\n***IV.*** **The Shadow AI and AppSec: What You Don\u2019t Know Will Get You!-ByteWhisper**\nThe over-the-top headlines about artificial intelligence (AI) have only been outstripped by the breakneck speed by which many are adopting AI to transform their organizations. Shadow AI creates significant security exposures, like development teams processing sensitive customer data through unauthorized AI tools for creating mission-critical solutions using unvetted open-source AI models. This session will focus on where Shadow AI and appsec intersect \u2013 the coding co-pilots, the platforms, and the risks that they represent to your organization. This session will provide an overview of Shadow AI, how application development might unknowingly create Shadow AI, and tools to identify and mitigate Shadow AI."

Why do the same old known security issues keep getting exploited even though you're spending more than ever on your security program? And why are engineers and security teams all frustrated with each other still? Come join in an airing of grievances about how security teams and \"shift left\" is failing our engineering partners, and a pragmatic step-by-step look at how we can work better together to deliver high quality engineering solutions.\n\n**Followed up by a panel on *\u201cAppSec in 2025: How Do We Keep Up?\u201d***\n**Panelists: Jeevan Singh, Farshad Abasi, Clara Andress, Arjun Gopalakrishna**\n**Moderator: Sarah Liu**\n\nSpace is limited so register soon."
