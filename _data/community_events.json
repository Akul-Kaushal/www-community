        "description": "**IMPORTANT:**\n\n* **You need to reverse into the parking spot!**\n\nOWASP Aarhus and Siemens Gamesa are happy to invite you to this OWASP Aarhus meetup - in Brande.\n\n**19:00 \u2013 19:10** Morten Thrane\nWelcome by Siemens Gamesa and OWASP Aarhus\n\n**19:10 \u2013 20:00** Matija Stevanovic\n**Title:** *Safeguarding Wind Power \u2013 Cybersecurity in the context of Wind Power Plants*\n**Abstract:**\nIn recent years, the global energy landscape has undergone a remarkable transformation, with renewable energy sources emerging as pivotal players in the pursuit of a sustainable future. Among these, wind power has surged to the forefront, harnessing the natural force of wind to generate clean and efficient electricity. As we embrace the transition towards greener energy solutions, it is imperative that we also confront the challenges that accompany it. One such challenge, though perhaps less visible, is cybersecurity.\nThroughout this presentation, we will delve into the intricacies of cybersecurity as it pertains to wind power plants. We will explore the broader business context, provide overview of customer expectations and the increasingly stringent requirements imposed by national legislators. Additionally, we will sketch the threats and vulnerabilities facing these critical assets. Finally, we will provide an overview of the strategies and technologies deployed to mitigate these risks, ensuring the resilience and safety of our wind power infrastructure amidst the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats.\n\n**20:00 \u2013 20:30** Networking break\n\n**20:30 \u2013 21:25** Aleksander Kj\u00e6r vil give en grundl\u00e6ggende introduktion til forhandling baseret p\u00e5 Harvard Negotiations Project og Uri & Fishers bog \"Getting to Yes\".\n\nHan vil introducere n\u00f8glekoncepterne og teknikkerne inden for forhandling og vise, hvordan deltagerne selv kan anvende disse til at forbedre deres forhandlingsevner - b\u00e5de professionelt og personligt. Det er hans holdning, at alle kan blive en dygtig forhandler!\nDerudover vil han illustrere disse teknikker med konkrete eksempler fra virkelige forhandlingssituationer.\n\nHan vil ogs\u00e5 pr\u00e6sentere, hvordan man kan overbevise en tv\u00e6r og n\u00e6rrig ledelse om at investere mere i IT-sikkerhed ved hj\u00e6lp af de forhandlingsteknikker, der har gennemg\u00e5et.\n\nKort om Aleksander - Jeg har en kandidatgrad i \u00f8konomi og antropologi og har altid haft stor interesse for forhandling gennem mine studier, is\u00e6r i en international kontekst. Bl.a. var jeg i praktik p\u00e5 den danske ambassade i Tallinn Estland i 2018, hvor der skete en masse inden for det milit\u00e6re og cyber- og informationssikkerhed omr\u00e5det i Danmark og Estland. Efterf\u00f8lgende tilbragte jeg fire m\u00e5neder i New York City, hvor jeg skrev mit speciale om danske virksomheders udfordringer med at etablere sig p\u00e5 det amerikanske marked. P\u00e5 nuv\u00e6rende tidspunkt studerer jeg softwareteknologi p\u00e5 6. semester og er s\u00e6rligt interesseret i governance-omr\u00e5det inden cyber- og informationssikkerhed, som jeg h\u00e5ber at g\u00f8re en karriere indenfor i fremtiden.\n\n**21:15 \u2013 21:30** Closing notes, networking and goodbyes"

So how difficult does it become to unshare? This talk will dig into all the different ways your secrets might get replicated, propagated, persisted, and shared, for decades following your mistake.\n\n**Talk#3** The Internet is broken, Putting IPv6 into perspective\n**Description**:\nMost of the Internet is currently running on a legacy version of the Internet Protocol: IPv4. Despite of this, the number of engineers, especially in security, who know how to use IPv6 is relatively low. In this talk, previously presented internally at NCC Group, I will show you why today's Internet does not live up to its original vision, take you back to the past to show you what the IPv4 Internet used to look like and through this reveal the secrets that will make you understand IPv6.\n\n**Speaker**:**Denis Smajlovi\u0107,** Founding Security Consultant at Nova Information Security.

        "description": "Hello everyone, we're excited to invite you to our OWASP Chapter meeting #65! Our Chapter serves central Germany, particularly within the Rhine-Main (Hesse) region, as a platform to discuss and share information and application security topics. Anyone who is interested and enthusiastic about application security or security in general is welcome. All meetings are free and open. You do not have to be an OWASP member.\n\nThere will also be plenty of time to socialize before and after the event.\n\n_What are we going to talk about?\n\n**1\\. Talk:** **Data Centricity for Cloud and Application Security**\n\n*Prof. Dr. Igor Podebrad, Director CISO Office, Google Cloud*\n\nIgor's talk will demystify data-centricity as a key driver for robust application and cloud security. He'll contrast the shift to data-centricity focus how it underpins cloud, AI and supports sound risk decisions. He will also discuss how this shift is reshaping security and resilience in for digital transformation. Igor is currently a Director at Google Cloud's Office of the CISO and a former Group CISO at Commerzbank AG. He holds a PhD in Medical Care Logistics from the University of Berlin.\n\n**2\\. Talk: Securing GenAI Applications on Cloud: Three pronged approach**\n\n*Hari Hayagreevan, Technical Leader \u2013 AI Security, IBM Consulting DACH*\n\nThe convergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) with cybersecurity introduces a spectrum of challenges and prospects. To embrace Gen AI extensively within enterprise contexts, it's imperative for these AI systems to be devoid of vulnerabilities in their application and infrastructure. This necessitates a holistic approach to securing Gen AI platforms. In this session, Hari will take you through the different viewpoints, offering insights from an Enterprise Security Architect\u2019s perspective, with practical enterprise scenarios. Hari is Enterprise Security Architect and currently is the Technical Leader for IBM Consulting\u2019s GenAI Security practice in DACH. He started his career as Cybersecurity incident responder (SOC Analyst) 18 years ago and now advises Enterprise CISOs and Security Architecture teams on adopting security principles for preventing cyber attacks.\n\n_Afterwards?\nWe will pre- and conclude the evening with the possibility of **socializing** at the venue with **free food and cold & hot drinks**. For everyone who's interested, we will continue socializing at the Bockenheimer Weinkontor afterward.\n\n_When?\nOur Meetup takes place on 24.04.2024 from 18.00 to 21.30 o'clock CEST.\n\n_Where?\ncodecentric AG, Lise-Meitner-Stra\u00dfe 4, 60486 Frankfurt am Main\n\n_Interested in **giving a talk** yourself?\nSubmit your talk here: https://www.papercall.io/owasp-chapter-frankfurt\n\n_And now?\nSave the date, **spread the word,** and bring your friends and colleagues along to our event.\n\n_Follow Us!\nAlso, follow us here and refer to our [OWASP Frankfurt site](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-germany/stammtische/frankfurt/) for information, including slides and recordings of previous presentations\n\nWe're looking forward to seeing you at our event!"

Meeting this challenge is not just about building secure applications since we all know that rapid development of software as well as the evolution of threats and vulnerabilities can see our applications as secure today but vulnerable tomorrow. That is why having an established product security team and response capability is extremely important.\nDuring this discussion, I will discuss, using real-world examples, including that of my own, how organizations can meet the demands of product security including:\n\n* Building a culture of security within your organization beyond firewalls and anti-virus\n* How to \u201csell\u201d security to executive management and explaining what product security does and doesn\u2019t do (e.g., staffing, budgets, etc.)\n* Building and deploying software using the \"DevOps\" approach, while maintaining a high level of security\n* Difficulties of wearing multiple hats, with security being one of them\n* Embedding \u201csecurity\u201d in the software development life cycle (SDLC)\n* Establishing a proper security \u201cresponse\u201d program\n* Product vulnerability transparency and developing a disclosure policy\n* How to measure the success of your program\n* Establishing a bug bounty program\n\n**THANKS to OUR SPONSOR**: *[DevOcean](https://www.devocean.security)*\n*DevOcean Unified Remediation Platform\u2122, a Gartner Cool Vendor, helps organizations cut the time, backlog, and manual effort needed to fix issues and manage threat exposure. Going beyond traditional methods, DevOcean enables security, dev and devops teams to collaborate efficiently without the usual pain and friction of day-to-day operations. Our powerful workflow automation engine leverages the unique context of cloud-to-code root cause analysis and ownership association to deliver a highly accurate remediation solution that drives resolution at scale.*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

But how do you know if you are actually using the vulnerable code? This talk will show you how to use two different types of tools to analyze reachability \u2013 deciding if the vulnerability needs to be prioritized based on your own code usage.\n\n**Workshop Overview:**\nThe workshop will be broken into several modules; introductory modules will cover the workshop organization and administrative matters (installing and configuring the tools used in the workshop). Subsequent modules will give an outline of what vulnerability reachability is and why it is important and compare/contrast the two main ways of understanding reachability (static call graphs and runtime analysis).\n\nNext, the workshop will present two short exercises, intended for the attendees to gain hands-on experience using both types of tools against real applications with real vulnerabilities. Interpreted languages (Java) and compiled languages (C/C++/Go) will be covered. Subsequently, the following module will walk through how to interpret the results obtained from the exercises and draw conclusions. The languages chosen are merely representative; the skills learned in the workshop are equally applicable to other languages.\n\nThe workshop will conclude with two modules which will present a short overview of commercial tools and a conclusion/wrap-up/Q&A session.\n\n**Workshop Outline:**\nI. Overview (10 minutes)\nA. Workshop organization\nB. About the tools and sample applications\n\n1. What are the tools and applications we are going to use?\n\nC. Obtaining/installing the tools and sample applications\n2\\. Cloning from the github repo\n\nD. Goals of the workshop (what you will learn)\n3\\.

Bj\u00f8rstad and Erlend Leiknes, mnemonic\n* **18:15-19:00 Testing race conditions has never been faster,** Sofia Lindqvist, Binary Security\n\n**Finding a three 0-day exploit chain in Ivanti EPMM and Ivanti Sentry**\nDuring the summer of 2023, a team at mnemonic discovered three 0-day vulnerabilities in Ivanti Endpoint Protection Manager Mobile (EPMM, formerly known as Mobileiron Core) and Ivanti Sentry.\n\n* CVE-2023-35078: authentication bypass in Ivanti EPMM, CVSS 9.8\n* CVE-2023-35081: path traversal / arbitrary file write in Ivanti EPMM, CVSS 7.2\n* CVE-2023-38035: authentication bypass in Ivanti Sentry, CVSS 9.8, allowing command execution as root.\n\nAll three vulnerabilities are listed in CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, as they are known to have been exploited by threat actors in the wild. Ivanti has also confirmed that the vulnerabilities can be combined in an exploit chain.\nIn this talk we'll take a closer look at what actually happened.\n\n**Speakers**\n\n* **Tor E. Bj\u00f8rstad** has spent his entire career in security and privacy. For the last decade he has worked as a principal security consultant at mnemonic, based in Oslo. He has mainly focused on software security and security architecture, with a particular interest in society-critical infrastructure. Tor holds a Ph.d. in cryptography from the University of Bergen.\n* **Erlend Leiknes**, a security consultant at mnemonic as, Oslo, spends his days as a penetration tester. His professional motto is that most vulnerabilities are obvious, the endeavor is to look at the right places. Erlend holds a master's degree in technical societal safety from University of Stavanger.\n\n**TESTING RACE CONDITIONS HAS NEVER BEEN FASTER**\n\nHistorically, testing for race condition vulnerabilities in web apps has been a painful ordeal, likely making race conditions an under-explored attack vector. In the summer of 2023, groundbreaking research by James Kettle completely changed the game, suddenly making it much easier for pentesters (and attackers) to test for this type of vulnerability. In this talk I will show how race conditions work, how to test for them and how to protect against them, based off an example vulnerability I found during a recent pentest.\n\n**Speaker**\n\n**Sofia Lindqvist**, security specialist, Binary Security\n\nSofia works as a security specialist at Binary Security. She started her career with a PhD in pure maths, followed by three years at Cisco developing one of their networking OSs. She eventually made her way into security testing, which she has been doing for a year and a half."

Our Chapter serves central Germany, particularly within the Rhine-Main (Hesse) region, as a platform to discuss and share information and application security topics. Anyone who is interested and enthusiastic about application security or security in general is welcome. All meetings are free and open. You do not have to be an OWASP member.\n\nThere will also be plenty of time to socialize before and after the event.\n\n_What are we going to talk about?\n\n**1\\. Talk:** **Data Centricity for Cloud and Application Security**\n\n*Prof. Dr. Igor Podebrad, Director CISO Office, Google Cloud*\n\nIgor's talk will demystify data-centricity as a key driver for robust application and cloud security. He'll contrast the shift to data-centricity focus how it underpins cloud, AI and supports sound risk decisions. He will also discuss how this shift is reshaping security and resilience in for digital transformation. Igor is currently a Director at Google Cloud's Office of the CISO and a former Group CISO at Commerzbank AG. He holds a PhD in Medical Care Logistics from the University of Berlin.\n\n**2\\. Talk: Securing GenAI Applications on Cloud: Three pronged approach**\n\n*Hari Hayagreevan, Technical Leader \u2013 AI Security, IBM Consulting DACH*\n\nThe convergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) with cybersecurity introduces a spectrum of challenges and prospects. To embrace Gen AI extensively within enterprise contexts, it's imperative for these AI systems to be devoid of vulnerabilities in their application and infrastructure. This necessitates a holistic approach to securing Gen AI platforms. In this session, Hari will take you through the different viewpoints, offering insights from an Enterprise Security Architect\u2019s perspective, with practical enterprise scenarios. Hari is Enterprise Security Architect and currently is the Technical Leader for IBM Consulting\u2019s GenAI Security practice in DACH. He started his career as Cybersecurity incident responder (SOC Analyst) 18 years ago and now advises Enterprise CISOs and Security Architecture teams on adopting security principles for preventing cyber attacks.\n\n_Afterwards?\nWe will pre- and conclude the evening with the possibility of **socializing** at the venue with **free food and cold & hot drinks**. For everyone who's interested, we will continue socializing at the Bockenheimer Weinkontor afterward.\n\n_When?\nOur Meetup takes place on 24.04.2024 from 18.00 to 21.30 o'clock CEST.\n\n_Where?\ncodecentric AG, Lise-Meitner-Stra\u00dfe 4, 60486 Frankfurt am Main\n\n_Interested in **giving a talk** yourself?\nSubmit your talk here: https://www.papercall.io/owasp-chapter-frankfurt\n\n_And now?\nSave the date, **spread the word,** and bring your friends and colleagues along to our event.\n\n_Follow Us!\nAlso, follow us here and refer to our [OWASP Frankfurt site](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-germany/stammtische/frankfurt/) for information, including slides and recordings of previous presentations\n\nWe're looking forward to seeing you at our event!"
