Pizza and soda will be provided.\n\nThis talk will walk through threat modeling fundamentals with a fun Star Wars twist! Even what may seem the most impenetrable will always have a secret way in that can be exploited. Be it an error in code, an unaccounted-for perspective, or a convenient airshaft leading to the center of a giant, black, round spacecraft, a developer must be aware of potential weaknesses. Using threat models is like getting the blueprint to the Death Star. They allow you to plan for potential scenarios or ambush attacks from stormtroopers with impossibly bad aim. Understanding the possible risks ensures your entire team will make it back to the Millennium Falcon. In this talk, Audrey Long will walk you through understanding threats in a cloud system and how to protect yourself from the dark side.\n\nAudrey Long is a highly qualified Senior Security Software Engineer at Microsoft, holding a Master of Science degree in Cybersecurity from Johns Hopkins University. Audrey is passionate about building secure solutions with customers and ensuring that security practices and considerations are built into products from the very beginning. Her expertise includes creating secure coding solutions, performing security risk assessments with threat modeling activities, evaluating security in architecture, and implementing security practices at the development level."

Thank you to those that attended.\n\nIn our last meetup, attendees voted for [YOI Indonesian Fusion](https://yoirestaurant.com.au/) as our location for next month. On 30th October 2024 6PM, there we shall meet.\n\n*There's NO BOOKING. If you're the first to arrive, please grab a table for the group and post a picture of the table's location in the comments of this meetup event. We'll use it to locate each other. (If you don't see a post, you're lucky first. Please grab us a table and post a pic. )*\n\n**Please remember to update your RSVP if you can no longer attend.** Even if it's just 30 minutes prior. It'll help whomever that arrives first know how big a table to get.\n\nWe're looking forward to the discussions we had once again.\n\nSee you there.\n\nMore details on the format, and what to expect below:\n\n**The Practitioner's Roundtable**\nIt's a monthly meetup, for AppSec/ProdSec practitioners to participate discussing AppSec/ProdSec topics and share knowledge. There's no speakers, or sponsors; just a facilitator, with the expectation that you'll join the conversations. Broadly, the idea is that you're swinging by after work, for a regular catch-up with our peers over dinner (with F&B at your own cost) with a known format.\n\\-\\-\\-\n**So, what's happening?**\nThe format:\n\n1. At 6pm all attendees arrive, and order (and pay for) their own meals - we'll do the rest while waiting for the meals to arrive and as we eat.\n2. All attendees write down on a card 1-2 AppSec/ProdSec related topics they'd like to discuss.\n3. We'll all each cast 3 votes on the cards we'd like to discuss.\n4. We'll sort the cards, and discuss the topics with the top 3-4 highest votes. Starting with the topic with the highest votes.\n5. After 5(?) minutes, we all decide if we'd like to continue or move on to the next topic.\n6. If we continue, after 15(?) minutes, we all move on to the next topic of discussion.\n7. At 7pm, we wrap up and officially end. Before everyone leaves, we vote on the next restaurant that we'll meet at.\n\nThis is[ inspired by Lean Coffee](https://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/), and intended for participants to be collaborators in the conversation focused on AppSec & ProdSec topics. You are expected to participate in the AppSec/ProdSec conversations constructively if you attend. This isn't the right place for BizDev focused conversations.\n\nFor the location selection, here are the considerations we work with:\n\n1. It must be within 1 \"city block\" of the Melbourne Free Tram Zone.\n2. The typical price for a whole meal (without alcohol) should be under $50 per person.\n3. It must allow individual orders - you'd be ordering and paying for your own meal.\n4. It will need to have seating space for the group to say, just walk-in to the restaurant ( this may change if it grows beyond 10 regular attendees ).\n5. It must be quiet enough for us to have meaningful conversations.\n6. It must not be a restaurant we've been to in the past 6 months. (Just to keep things fresh )\n\nAlso, although we use the word \u201crestaurant\u201d this is used broadly to mean food establishment - if we\u2019re all keen on hitting up a decent kebab place, that works. As a courtesy to the venue, there's an expectation that you'd order something there."

His work aims to bridge the gap between advanced AI capabilities and robust, secure software engineering principles.\n\n**Securing GenAI Applications - a Point of View**\n*Abstract:*\nThe POV discusses the importance of securing generative AI (GenAI) and the challenges associated with it. GenAI empowers organizations to unlock new opportunities, drive innovation, and deliver value in an increasingly digital and dynamic world. However, securing GenAI introduces new challenges that must be addressed, including adversarial risks across the AI pipeline, data privacy and security concerns, and the need for a unified approach to security. The POV highlights the importance of understanding the risks associated with input, training, and output data, as well as the need for data provenance, transparency, and accountability. Further to this, it looks into the risks posed by use of GenAI, the importance of security in a GenAI strategy, and how we need to go about mitigating risks in practice; factoring in the different GenAI consumption models and the impact these will have on Security Management.\nThe POV concludes by highlighting the importance of understanding GenAI\u2019s risks and challenges and taking a proactive approach to securing it.\n*Bio:*\nBur\u00e7 Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m is a seasoned Cyber Risk Services professional with over 20 years of experience in the security industry, specializing in offensive security.

Johan Sydseter**\n\n**Gamification of Threat Modeling for Machine Learning**\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has established itself as an important part of our lives, with machine learning spearheading the most notable innovations in the last two decades. Publications about prompt injection and similar attacks get a lot of attention. However, these are far from the only security issues with machine learning systems. We also have to think about challenges like poisoned data, recursive data pollution and all the personally identifiable information the models have memorized, as well as other inherent weaknesses with stochastic systems. Too much focus is directed towards operational security in the OPS part of of MLOps, while the shift-left idea of building systems \"secure by design\" during planning and development does not get enough emphasis. Threat modeling and risk analysis will likely play an important role in the future of machine learning security. I introduce Elevation of MLsec, which is an extension of Shostack's threat modeling card game Elevation of Privilege, and based on the risk framework published by the Berryville Institute of Machine Learning (BIML). In this talk, we will demystify how machine learning systems actually work and explore how the threat modeling game can help us engineer more secure machine learning systems.\n\n**Let\u2019s play OWASP Cornucopia!**\nOWASP Cornucopia is a card game to assist software development teams identify security requirements in agile software development processes. It is language, platform, and technology agnostic.\n\nIn this session we will learn to play the game in a different way from what we usually do. Johan Sydseter, OWASP Cornucopia co-lead and game master will take you through a provocative scenario. Confronted with the grumpy old senior developer that refuses to shift-left due to too many hours working overtime on his incredible sophisticated pet projects, what will you do? Will you be able to teach him a lesson about why security is important, or will he be laughing all the way to his developer cave? Only true passionate application security engineers will succeed. Expect confetti, swags, (yes, you read right, swag, valued just below the corruption limit) and illegal bribes as you venture into the unknown of OWASP Cornucopia.\n\n**Speakers**\n\n**Elias Brattli S\u00f8rensen** is a software engineer & security champion at Kantega SSO, engineering digital identity standards for secure authentication to the Atlassian ecosystem while facilitating and promoting secure software development practices. M. Sc. in Computer Science at NTNU, researching usage of static analysis tools like Spotbugs to find vulnerabilities in OpenID Connect client implementations.\n\n**Johan Sydseter** is co-leader for OWASP\u00ae Cornucopia and Co-creator of the OWASP\u00ae Cornucopia Mobile App Edition.

Fresh meat in App Sec and OWASP but has 15 years' experience building and designing backend and frontend solutions as a designer, developer and architect. He has held several presentations on appsec at various international conferences, loves confetti and funny glasses.\n\n**About OWASP and OWASP Chapter meetings**\nOWASP is an online community that produces freely available articles, methods, documentation, tools, and technologies in IoT, system software, and web application security.\nOWASP Chapters exist to build a community of application security professionals worldwide.

We will have door prizes and excellent food for all to enjoy, as you take advantage of this excellent networking opportunity!\nPlease feel free to pass this information on to your peers and team members.+\n\nPlease reply **\u201cONSITE\u201d** if you plan on attending in person so we can finalize headcount for food and room attendance \n\nSocial Hour after\n\n**Presentations will include:**\n***I. Containers 101-Optiv***\nContainer Security Best Practices and Tooling-Optiv\n\n***II. Securing APIs in the Cloud: Insights and Best Practices- Palo Alto***\nThis presentation explores the security challenges and opportunities in containerization, emphasizing a defense-in-depth approach. We begin by discussing the widespread adoption of containers and the emerging trends driving innovation, such as serverless computing and hybrid/multi-cloud environments. We then examine key security concerns, including container sprawl, misconfigurations, and supply chain vulnerabilities. A defense-in-depth strategy, starting with shifting security left during development, followed by securing images at rest and implementing runtime protection, ensures comprehensive container security. By integrating cloud workload protection platforms (CWPP) with broader CNAPP strategies, organizations can safeguard containers throughout their entire lifecycle, from code to production\n\n***III. From Reactive to Effective: Building Application Security that Works-Mend IO***\n\nIn 2023, 71% of enterprises admitted their AppSec programs were reactive, playing catch-up with vulnerability alerts -\u2013 while at the same time, applications remain the top target for threat actors. That adds up to increased business risk for a lot of companies and fuels an urgent need to improve application security strategies. But how?\nThe key is to move from a compliance-based approach to managing application risk."

A great reason to hold a special Stammtisch outside of the regular schedule!\n\nThis is the most exciting time in the history of appsec. Not only are apps/APIs more complex, connected, and critical than ever before, we haven't made much progress against vulnerabilities, the attackers have ramped up their activity dramatically, and the governments of the world are scrambling to figure out what to do. It's a mess. In this talk, Jeff will share some stories and insights from over 25 years in appsec. We'll look at some of the bigger movements in appsec like \"build security in\", \"devsecops\", \"shift left\", \"SBOMs\", and \"secure by design\" and talk about why they have largely failed to change the trajectory of appsec. We'll also spend some time on the different technologies organizations use to automate appsec in development and operations. Jeff will share his thoughts about the market failures that make improvements in appsec so difficult and what we can do to fix them. This will be a highly interactive session, so bring your questions and ideas.\n\n**Novatec Consulting** will host this Stammtisch at their venue \u2013 thank you very much, we truly appreciate your support in making this event possible!\nMeetup participants can park in the underground garage. You will be able to validate your parking tickets to cover the parking fees.\n\n**Agenda:**\n\n* **6:00 PM**: Arrival\n* **6:30 PM - 7:30 PM**: Talk\n* **7:30 PM - approximately 9:00 PM**: Pizza, drinks, discussion, and networking"
