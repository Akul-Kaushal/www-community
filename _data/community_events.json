We will talk about how fuzzing can be used to detect program errors unrelated to project requirements. The main focus will be fuzzing functions, with known source code, that receive input from untrusted sources.\n\n20:00 \u2013 20:30 Networking break\n\n20:30 \u2013 21:25 \"Secure SDLC with a DevOps Flavor!\" by Jim Manico\n\nJoin Jim Manico for an enlightening session on \"Secure SDLC with a DevOps Flavor!\" where he merges cutting-edge DevOps practices with robust security measures. In this talk, Jim will delve into automating security within the CI/CD pipeline to ensure continuous security integration, advocate for a shift-left approach to catch vulnerabilities early, and discuss implementing Security as Code to maintain consistent security configurations. He will also emphasize the importance of fostering a DevSecOps culture where security is a shared responsibility across all teams. Additionally, Jim will outline essential tools and technologies that enhance security in DevOps environments, and stress the significance of monitoring security metrics for continuous improvement. This session is a must-attend for professionals seeking to integrate effective security practices into their development cycles without sacrificing speed or efficiency."

This talk will introduce the concepts of \"weaknesses\", \"atomic tests\" and \"demos\" that are the basis of the upcoming MASTG v2. Attendees will gain practical knowledge through detailed examples that show the journey from definition to implementation using both static and dynamic analysis techniques available in MASTG. In addition, discover the newly developed MAS test apps designed to streamline research and improve the development of robust MAS tests.\n\nDon't miss this opportunity to improve your mobile app security skills and make your apps hack-proof. Whether you're looking to bolster your defenses or learn how to uncover vulnerabilities, this session will provide you with the cutting-edge resources you need to stay ahead in mobile security!"

Then we'll dive into the project's GitHub repository and start hacking away at issues. We'll have mentors on hand to help you get started and answer any questions you have. All skill levels are welcome!\n\nNever submitted a pull request before? No problem! We'll walk you through the process and help you get your first open source contribution under your belt.\nAre you an expert in one specific area of application security? Come contribute to the project by writing a new cheat sheet or improving an existing one.\nJust getting started? Come and learn from experts, and contribute by fixing typos, improving formatting, or adding examples to existing cheat sheets. You don't need to be a technical expert to participate in open source!\nHave tons of experience? Come help mentor others and review their pull requests.\n\nWe'll unleash the group on the project and see how much we can accomplish in a couple hours. There will be food for all attendees, and we'll have special **awards** for the top contributors in various categories.\n\n**Bring your laptop!

Her many years of practical experience with ML in general, and DL, NLP, LLMs and others before the Coming of ChatGPT makes her approach chill and dehyped. Irina will give tips on how to protect your solution from LLM leaking data/PII, treating users inadequately or giving bad advice. Our expert's good advice will be focusing on local-first solutions, which she has accumulated experience in, as it is the choice of implementation which is reasonably favorable in a sanctioned country. However, folks implementing business solutions using the popular LLM APIs are expected to get their valuable share of advice too.

The current session applies his many years of cybersec leadership and navigating secure development in large financial institutions to the new situation created by the emerging omnipresence of LLMs -- how SDLC, secure software development methodologies and practices change. The session will be showing small, practical examples of using LLMs and hopefully give attendees food for thought to run their own experiments (and share back to OWASP anything useful!)

This talk will describe the similarities and differences in the functioning of LLMs compared to human psychology, touching on topics of memory, thinking/reasoning, cognitive biases and stereotypes, goals and motivation, emotions, and consciousness.

Introduction to OWASP Ottawa, Public Announcements.\n2. **API: Always Prone to Injections**\n\n**Abstract:**\nWhen pushing left goes past the developer: To the documentation! Simple documentation errors are a big contributor to injection vulnerabilities of all kinds, especially the way many cloud APIs are documented. In this presentation I\u2019ll walk through several examples, and then get hands on with a demo vulnerability (and hopefully some laughs). We\u2019ll highlight how to spot these kinds of problems in documentation as a developer, and avoid making them yourselves when providing an API.\n\n**Speakers:**\n**Chris Shepherd** is a pentesting lead, privacy advocate, and avid homelabber. With over 20 years of experience in roles from systems & network administration to software development to pentesting, he's worked on all facets of application development, deployment, and use. With a lifelong passion for security, Chris turned that jack of all trades experience towards pentesting, with a focus on education. For the past four years he has volunteered as a key challenge developer and overall challenge development co-ordinator for the CyberSCI CTF."
