This talk will delve into the strategic importance of these concepts, emphasizing how they can preemptively identify and mitigate potential security threats. We will explore the methodologies behind attack surface mapping, highlighting the necessity of viewing your infrastructure through the lens of an attacker to uncover vulnerabilities that might otherwise go unnoticed. By embracing this mindset, organizations can proactively defend against sophisticated attacks, ensuring their defenses are as robust and comprehensive as possible.\n\nThe talk will shift to a demonstration, centered around the Amass Project, OWASP\u2019s powerful tool designed for in-depth attack surface mapping and asset discovery. Attendees will have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with Amass, learning how to leverage its capabilities to uncover and visualize the full extent of an organization\u2019s external exposure. The session will cover practical examples, showcasing how Amass can be integrated into security workflows to enhance situational awareness and threat intelligence. By the end of the presentation, participants will have a clear understanding of how to implement these strategies in their security programs, ultimately fortifying their defenses against potential adversaries."

However, traditional approaches (blocklisting, brute force, etc.) have proven ineffective and are, oftentimes, too late to prevent any real security issues.\nIn this session, we\u2019ll discuss some of the psychology behind why we\u2019re referred to as the \u201cdepartment of NO\u201d as well as how to start shifting that perception. You will also learn of some tactics to identify and mitigate shadow IT as well as proactive measures that may help avoid future sprawl."

We'll guide you through the process of identifying these anti-patterns and provide insights to effectively defend against such attacks.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nAnjum is the Director of Security Research at Traceable.ai. He has worked on different aspects of security engineering specifically Detection engineering & Incident response, AppSec and Threat Intelligence. He has presented at conferences like BSidesSF, BSidesCharm, and has multiple patents issued for IOT Security.\n\n**Talk 2:**\nSpeaker: Daniel Davis\n\nTitle: Had a Cyber Incident? Better Call Saul!\n\nAbstract: If you\u2019re a CISO, you\u2019re already calling your lawyer. The rest of you are going - huh??? From the SEC\u2019s legal action against Solarwinds to the looming specters of CMMC 2.0 and CIRCIA, when will cybersecurity\u2019s transformation into a legal domain be complete?\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nNo, Daniel isn\u2019t a lawyer, but he did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night (does that one still hold up???). Cybersecurity isn\u2019t the first technical discipline to be \u201clegal-lite\u201d as he learned running safety programs for military aerospace programs. When things go wrong, people will always want to know who \u201csigned off on it\u201d.\nThis experience led Daniel to Lyft\u2019s autonomous vehicle division to create a public-private partnership to develop a framework for safety and cybersecurity for AVs. Today, he\u2019s the founder of Mindpipe, which will be open sourcing a next generation, end-to-end RAG pipeline leveraging open knowledge graph frameworks."

We\u2019re eager to share with the community a practical and innovative approach that worked for us: How we were able to move away from manually reviewing every feature developed while increasing the thoroughness of our security oversight. We\u2019ll explain how we succeeded at integrating generative AI tools using GitHub actions to automate the code review process and broaden security oversight in a highly efficient way. Attendees will learn from our journey and discover how they, too, can automate routine security checks, engaging human experts only when their expertise is truly needed.\n 19:20 to 19:30 - Beer Break\n 19:30 to 20:15 - Pains and advantages of application anomaly detection in containerized applications\n*Ben Hirschberg - CTO @ ARMO*\nIn this talk an open-source based application anomaly detection system to detect malicious activity. The solution focuses on applications running in Kubernetes orchestration system.\nIn the talk I will cover these points:\n\\* Main attack vectors to these kinds of applications: exploit remote vulnerabilities, supply-chain attacks\n\\* Anomaly detection dimensions: process, file, network and system-call activity\n\\* What detection dimension is working (or not working) with what kind of applications\n\\* What anomalies are bound to what kind of attacks\n\\* Live demo with the Kubescape project to show results\n\n 20:15 to 21:00 - The Dark Side of AI: The Hidden Risks in Open-Source AI Models\n*Jossef Harush Kadouri - Security Researcher @ Checkmarx*\nThis talk is for anyone who is using open source in their daily routine. The purpose is to bring awareness to the risks of software supply chain attackers lurking in some of our open-source code and to show how ridiculously easy it is for them to launch attacks.\nJoin me as we unravel the construction of AI models, focusing on their weak spots. Through multiple demos, witness how AI models can be manipulated to become malicious.\n\n====================================================================\nThis event is hosted by Axonius in collaboration with OWASP Israel.\n\nJoin us at the event physically as we will not include Zoom or remote participation this time."

        "description": "Topic Name - Phishing Unveiled: Malicious JavaScript and First-Stage Loaders\n\nAbstract :\nPhishing attacks have become increasingly sophisticated, often using malicious JavaScript to initiate the first stage of infection. This session will explore how attackers deploy JavaScript within phishing campaigns to evade detection and deliver harmful payloads. We will examine real-world examples, identify key indicators of malicious activity, and discuss strategies for effective defense. Participants will leave with a clear understanding of the role of JavaScript in phishing and how to protect against these evolving threats.\n\nBio - Shrutirupa is an experienced Security Researcher with a proven track record in computer\nand network security.

Learn why every SCA tool is wrong, and how to deal with it.\nJoin us for great networking, dinner and drinks, and see a presentation by **Darren Meyer**, Lead Solution Architect at Endor Labs.\n\n**ABSTRACT**: With the rise of AI-fueled by Python-based libraries, it has become of paramount importance to scan Python-based projects and their dependencies for OSS vulnerabilities. Python relies on package managers like pip or conda to manage declared dependencies. Dependencies are declared in manifest files which the package manager uses to install the correct version of the required dependency. However, Python\u2019s dependency management system coupled with its dynamic type nature makes it an especially challenging language to deal with.\n\nOf particular focus is the phenomenon of phantom dependencies which are unreported dependencies in a project's manifest profile. These hidden dependencies, which are often provided dependencies (which is especially true for libraries such as tensorflow and pytorch which are essential for AI), challenge software composition analysis (SCA) of Python code, impacting the reliability of vulnerability results.\n\n**Thanks to our Sponsor**: *[Endor Labs](https://www.endorlabs.com/)*\n*Endor Labs\u2019 Dependency Lifecycle Management Platform is designed to address the weakest link in software supply chain security: the ungoverned sprawl of open source software in the enterprise. Endor Labs\u2019 mission is to help developers spend less time dealing with security issues and more time accelerating development through safe code reuse. With this solution, development and security teams are able to maximize software reuse by safely evaluating, maintaining, and updating dependencies at scale.*\n\n**Thanks to our Host**: *[HiveWatch](https://www.hivewatch.com/)*\n*Intelligent, efficient, and scalable security*\n*HiveWatch is a cloud-based SaaS platform built for physical security teams to enhance their current security technologies. It streamlines incident response, allows for the consolidation of disparate programs and systems, and reduces false alarms.*\n\n**SPONSORSHIP Opportunities Available**\n*Vendors interested in sponsoring please send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

Our sincere apologies for the silence these past few months; it's been a rough time, in many ways. The landscape and conditions for meetups have changed, especially in the last year, thus, we must adapt to carry-on.\n\nSo, what's happening?\nThe TLDR: We'd meet at 6pm on a Wednesday monthly (except Dec/Jan), at a (different) food place each meetup. Hangout, and together contribute and decide on the AppSec topics we'd want to discuss, while we all grab a bite to eat (at own cost). All these finishing up by 7pm.\n\nFor RSVPs, please do try to keep it updated so that whomever that arrives first at the food place, can try to grab a table/seats for us. We'd be trying to just walk-in and grabbing a table.\n\nPlease see this Google Form for the details, and a quick poll on which Wednesday y'all prefer: [https://forms.gle/U3ArrazUpt9R5EGH8](https://forms.gle/U3ArrazUpt9R5EGH8)\nWe'll close this poll by the 21st June 2024.\n\nWe've picked the first event's date and location, to get the ball rolling.\nSee you there.\nThank you."

Is it the OWASP Top Ten, formal guidelines established by organizations such as NIST, security stories developed by the product owner and the security team, or recommendations made by your development team? The answer is all the above depending on the client, your development environment, and your capacity to take the risk.\n\nThis presentation will share experiences gained from penetration testing of a web application hosted by a Government agency providing professional licenses to its prospective clients. The nature of the project touched numerous areas such as CJIS (Criminal Justice Information Service), Personal Identifiable Information (PII), Access Control (Authorization in particular), and adherence to the security standard\u2019s office guidelines. The challenge was to identify and prioritize the test suite that will cover these specific areas in a constrained time period. To enhance the coverage, the test suite had to include DAST (using ZAP) and some specific general scenarios.\n\nThe audience will take away some approaches that when applied can lead to a well balanced (both effective and efficient) penetration testing.\n\nSCHEDULE\nDoors open at 5:30. The talk will begin about 6pm.\n\nENTRY\nThere are doors on Washington and Broadway. Both of them auto-lock at 6pm. From 6 to 6:15pm, only the door on Broadway will be available. Take the elevator to the 11th floor.\n\nNO ENTRY AFTER 6:15 PM\nIt will not be possible to enter the building after 6:15.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nOur host again this month is NedSpace, a co-working space in downtown Portland--a friendly place to work when you don't want to work from home.\n\nFOOD\nWe don't yet have a sponsor for July, so there may not be food this time.

        "description": "** Welcome to the Summer Event of OWASP Estonia: Modern Cryptography - Vol. 2 **\n\n In this event we'll host two very special speakers:\n\n**Stefano Alberico**, tech lead mentor at **NATO DIANA** accelerator and founder at Skudo, is a technology visionary with 25 years of international experience.\n\nHe is very problem solving oriented and prefers to set up a demo with a Raspberry Pi rather than only explaining things on a PPT.\n\nHe is now focused on hardware encryption (HSM and PKI) for space and drone applications, based on Skudo's own FPGA implementation.\n\n Speech: **Practical use-cases of encrypted satellite communication**\n\nIn my 30-minute presentation, Stefano will discuss two key use-cases of encrypted digital satellite communication that his company has worked on.\n\nThe first use-case involves a project with the European Space Agency (ESA) last year. We remotely reprogrammed the OPS-SAT's onboard FPGA with our custom cores, adding a Hardware Security Module (HSM) and a RISC-V processor. We then developed an application that captured a satellite image, processed it on the RISC-V, encrypted it on the HSM, and sent it to our ground office. There, we decrypted the image using the appropriate key and displayed it, ensuring secure data transmission.\n\nThe second use-case is an ongoing project to create an encrypted satellite communication link. This involves integrating our HSM/FPGA with an Iridium modem using the Short Burst Data (SBD) service. This setup enables us to send end-to-end hardware-encrypted messages worldwide, ensuring secure and reliable communication.\n\nThese examples demonstrate our work in enhancing secure satellite communications through advanced encryption and processing technologies.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\n**Jelizaveta Vakarjuk** is a junior researcher in Cybernetica and industrial PhD student at Tallinn University of Technology. Her research focuses on post-quantum cryptography, privacy-preserving cryptography, and security of voting systems. Mainly she studies post-quantum digital signatures, but also focuses on the aspects of migration to post-quantum cryptography.\n\n Speech: **Obstacles of migration to post-quantum cryptography**\n\nWith the rising development of quantum technologies there is an urgent need to secure existing IT infrastructure against quantum threats. Introducing post-quantum cryptography to present systems could protect them against future quantum computer attacks. Still, post-quantum migration is a challenging process which requires systematic planning and years of execution. In this talk, I will share what are the main migration obstacles in example of Estonian e-services.\n\n **And That's Not All - More Surprises Await!** Whether you're a cybersecurity professional, a tech enthusiast, or just curious about cryptography, there's something for everyone!\n\n **Connect, Collaborate, and Create:** This event is more than just talks - it's a platform to connect with like-minded folks!\n\n **Mark Your Calendars:**\nThursday 04th July at 18:30 - 20:30\nWorkland Maakri 19\n\n **Limited seats, registration on Meetup required!** "

This talk will explore some of the real-world applications of this technology, in particular discussing adoption strategies, observability practices, and evaluating Webauthn against other strategies such as OAuth and 2FA.\n\n**Don Burks** is a technical leader who has been working in the industry for over 25 years. Former Head Instructor of Lighthouse Labs and with experience both in startups and FAANG companies, Don's background in software development and technical leadership has provided a wealth of experience which he shares in books, talks, and the great teams with which he gets to work. Currently, Don is the Director of Engineering for Bulletproof Studio Tools, based in Vancouver, BC."
