NI has been on a journey over the last several years to improve the security of its products driven by customer requirements, their expectations, and increasingly, regulations that require software to be developed with secure methodologies. Security is as much about a mindset and development culture as it is about tools, vulnerabilities, and security technologies.

However, within MOD we (like many organisations) face challenges that make Secure by Design hard for those responsible for implementing. In this talk, I will outline these challenges and talk about the role Dstl is playing to address them within MOD, and collectively with our partners across government.\n\nDr Shamal Faily is a Principal Scientist in the Software and Systems Dependability Team at Dstl. He is a Visiting Fellow at Bournemouth University, and previously held a range of academic posts at Robert Gordon University, Bournemouth University, UCL, and University of Oxford, including course leadership positions. Prior to his work in Higher Education, Shamal was a software engineer at Logica UK\u2019s Space & Defence division for nearly a decade. Shamal has long established interests in the design and secure and usable systems, and published over 100 peer-reviewed publications in Software Engineering, Cyber Security, HCI, and Computer Science Education. Shamal is also the lead developer of the open-source CAIRIS (Computer Aided Integration of Requirements and Information Security) platform, which is widely used for threat modelling.\n\n**Hays**\nCyber recruitment update from the Hays team.\n\n**Ashley Allen**\nNowadays, domestic smart security devices, such as smart locks, smart doorbells, and security cameras, are becoming increasingly popular with users due to their ease of use, convenience, and declining prices. Unfortunately, users have very few sources of unbiased information regarding product performance in real-world conditions and, as a result, tend to take manufacturer claims at face value. This means that users may be exposed to threats such as theft, impersonation, and even physical injury if the device fails and is used to prevent access to hazardous environments. This talk discusses recently published research, and in particular several attacks using popular wireless attack vectors (i.e., 433 MHz radio, Bluetooth, and RFID) against domestic smart security devices. Results suggest that users are open to considerable threats, irrespective of whether they use lesser known (i.e., no name) or branded smart security devices, due to the poor security offered by these devices.\n\nAshley Allen is a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Hertfordshire and a member of the Cybersecurity and Computing Systems research group. He holds an MSc in Computer Science (Cybersecurity) from Staffordshire University, UK. He has over 20 years of experience working in security roles in both the public and private sectors. He is currently Senior Security Engineer for Posit, PBC, an American data science company. His research interests include IoT security and federated learning.\n\n**Event and Venue**\nWe will be joining Hays Recruitment in their new offices in Bournemouth for this event, there is a limit on numbers, so signup is essential. Names will be required upon arrival to enter the building.\n\nThere will be food and drink provided for this event, so please let us know of any dietary requirements or allergies."

Johan Sydseter**\n\n**Gamification of Threat Modeling for Machine Learning**\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has established itself as an important part of our lives, with machine learning spearheading the most notable innovations in the last two decades. Publications about prompt injection and similar attacks get a lot of attention. However, these are far from the only security issues with machine learning systems. We also have to think about challenges like poisoned data, recursive data pollution and all the personally identifiable information the models have memorized, as well as other inherent weaknesses with stochastic systems. Too much focus is directed towards operational security in the OPS part of of MLOps, while the shift-left idea of building systems \"secure by design\" during planning and development does not get enough emphasis. Threat modeling and risk analysis will likely play an important role in the future of machine learning security. I introduce Elevation of MLsec, which is an extension of Shostack's threat modeling card game Elevation of Privilege, and based on the risk framework published by the Berryville Institute of Machine Learning (BIML). In this talk, we will demystify how machine learning systems actually work and explore how the threat modeling game can help us engineer more secure machine learning systems.\n\n**Let\u2019s play OWASP Cornucopia!**\nOWASP Cornucopia is a card game to assist software development teams identify security requirements in agile software development processes. It is language, platform, and technology agnostic.\n\nIn this session we will learn to play the game in a different way from what we usually do. Johan Sydseter, OWASP Cornucopia co-lead and game master will take you through a provocative scenario. Confronted with the grumpy old senior developer that refuses to shift-left due to too many hours working overtime on his incredible sophisticated pet projects, what will you do? Will you be able to teach him a lesson about why security is important, or will he be laughing all the way to his developer cave? Only true passionate application security engineers will succeed. Expect confetti, swags, (yes, you read right, swag, valued just below the corruption limit) and illegal bribes as you venture into the unknown of OWASP Cornucopia.\n\n**Speakers**\n\n**Elias Brattli S\u00f8rensen** is a software engineer & security champion at Kantega SSO, engineering digital identity standards for secure authentication to the Atlassian ecosystem while facilitating and promoting secure software development practices. M. Sc. in Computer Science at NTNU, researching usage of static analysis tools like Spotbugs to find vulnerabilities in OpenID Connect client implementations.\n\n**Johan Sydseter** is co-leader for OWASP\u00ae Cornucopia and Co-creator of the OWASP\u00ae Cornucopia Mobile App Edition. The man with the long hair, not the long beard. Fresh meat in App Sec and OWASP but has 15 years' experience building and designing backend and frontend solutions as a designer, developer and architect. He has held several presentations on appsec at various international conferences, loves confetti and funny glasses.\n\n**About OWASP and OWASP Chapter meetings**\nOWASP is an online community that produces freely available articles, methods, documentation, tools, and technologies in IoT, system software, and web application security.\nOWASP Chapters exist to build a community of application security professionals worldwide. Our Oslo OWASP Chapter's meetings are free and open to everyone to attend, so both members and non-members are always welcome. Local meetings include:\n\n* Training to improve your skills\n* Lectures that are relevant to your work\n* Networking capabilities"

Has anyone ever asked you do a secure code review on a PR, or implement some tooling to run automated code scans? Did you answer no to all of this but still think it might be interesting? Then please join me as we do an introductory session on performing Secure Code reviews and take a look at some code scanning options with their fairly simple code base integrations!\n\nP.S. Your OWASP Philly team is looking to bring you a Secure Code CTF in October for Security Awareness Month, so this may or may not be useful!\n\nExcited to see everyone!\n-Higgs"

        "description": "Hi,\nWe are Polish chapter of [OWASP](https://owasp.org/) \\- worldwide\\, non\\-profit organisation focused on application security issues\\.\nThis time we have invited **Grzegorz Niedziela** and **Louis Nyffenegger**.\n\n**[Louis Nyffenegger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/snyff/)** the founder of [PentesterLab](https://pentesterlab.com/), will talk about JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).\n**[Grzegorz Niedziela](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gniedziela/)**, \"[Bug Bounty Reports Explained](https://www.youtube.com/c/BugBountyReportsExplained)\" Youtube channel host will have a talk about OAuth security.\nAfter talks, we will discuss bright and dark sides of bug bounty.\n\nAgenda:\n\n1. **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) (Louis Nyffenegger)**\nNowadays, JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are ubiquitous, serving as session tokens, OAuth tokens, or simply as a means to pass information between applications or microservices. However, by design, JWTs contain numerous security and cryptography pitfalls that can lead to serious vulnerabilities. In this talk, we will explore how to exploit some of these issues.\n2. **OAuth Secrets (Grzegorz Niedziela)**\nThese days, Oauth is a key protocol, allowing us to log in with one click to many websites. As anything, this convenience doesn\u2019t come without a cost. The cost here is the risk of an account takeover bug. And that\u2019s not only changing the redirect_uri to an attacker-controlled host which, for many hackers, is the only attack they know. That attack won't work too well in 2024. This talk will be about exploiting smaller misconfigurations. For example, what do to if you only control the path of the redirect_uri or how to exfiltrate the code when your open doesn't preserve parameters. It will also focus on particular auth providers and how they don't make it hard for us by being way more relaxed than the standard defines.\n3. After the break, we will be hosting a **discussion about bug boutnty**. We want to discuss both sides - bug bounters and companies which have bug bounty programs.\nHow to report vulnerabilities? Where to seek? What should be your goal - easy bugs occuring en masse or sophisticated kill-chains? What to expect? Bug bounty myths and reality.\nHow bug bounty might help your organisation? What are the real costs of having bb program? What can go wrong? How to manage good bb program? Bug bounty or penetration testing?\n\nAbout our guests:\n**[Louis Nyffenegger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/snyff/)** is a seasoned security engineer and the founder of [PentesterLab](https://pentesterlab.com/), a platform dedicated to teaching web penetration testing and security code review.\n**[Grzegorz Niedziela](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gniedziela/)** \\- I'm a hacker who documents his journey by creating and curating the best content for you in the form of [videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/BugBountyReportsExplained) and [newsletter](https://www.bugbountyexplained.com/).\n\nPlease RSVP and save the date!\nIf you have a minute, **please share this invitation** with friends and in your social media."

When doing so, we need to keep in mind that strong security isolation was not a design objective for containers. There are limits to the provided isolation and also unexpected ways to break the isolation completely through misconfiguration.\n\nIn this blue team focused talk we will review Docker security (mis-)configurations I\u2019ve seen in the wild. We will consider WHY they are dangerous (there will be demos!) and HOW to fix them.\n\nThe talk is focused on intended (albeit dangerous) functionality, there will be no 0-days. Also, container orchestration technologies will not be covered - a lot of presented scenarios would be applicable, but there is additional attack surface not considered in this talk.\n\n**Amiran** is an OWASP Vancouver board member and is a passionate product security professional with over 20 years of technology experience in a variety of roles. As a security engineering leader, Amiran is advocating a pragmatic approach to security where partnership between security, builder, and platform teams result in security becoming a business enabler."
