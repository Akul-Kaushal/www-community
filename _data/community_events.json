        "description": "**Overview:**\nOperational technology (OT) perimeters are rapidly emerging as a new frontier for attackers, mirroring the adversarial challenges seen in traditional IT boundaries. This talk explores crucial vulnerability classes and real-world exploitation tacticsaffecting common OT perimeter technologies. We will highlight significant risks and potential impacts of perimeter compromise on industrial environments. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the emerging threats at the OT boundary and the exploitation techniques adversaries may leverage.\n\n**Abstract:**\nAttacking IACS: Strategic Industrial Exploitation Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) underpin critical infrastructure worldwide but often rely on outdated security paradigms, which may leave them vulnerable to modern attacks. This presentation explores technical attack methodologies targeting IACS, contrasting them with traditional enterprise network exploitation techniques. Drawing on extensive experience in vulnerability research, exploit development, and red teaming, I will highlight the unique challenges and attacker opportunities presented by IACS environments\u2014such as reliance on legacy technologies, proprietary protocols, and stringent operational constraints.\n\nStructured around the IEC/TR 62443-3-1 standard, this presentation addresses critical gaps in modern security guidance for IACS environments. I will use examples to demonstrate strategic attack opportunities and illustrate how vulnerabilities are exploited differently within industrial settings compared to enterprise environments. Attendees will gain technical insights into the challenges of securing IACS against sophisticated attacks and leave with actionable defense strategies that address current IACS security gaps."

Join us for networking with your peers and a featured talk from [Parker Brissette](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parkerbrissette) presenting:\n\nBuilding a Modern AppSec Pipeline: Continuous Security in the DevSecOps World\n\nIn today's evolving security landscape, traditional approaches fall short. Discover how to build a modern AppSec pipeline for continuous security in the DevSecOps world. We'll tackle the speed vs. security dilemma, explore common bottlenecks, and highlight the cost of late-stage discoveries. Learn the fundamentals of an AppSec pipeline, its integration into CI/CD, and key components like automated scanning, security as code, and vulnerability management.\n\nGain practical insights into implementation strategies, tool selection, and securing buy-in. A real-world case study will showcase tangible benefits and lessons learned. We'll also address common pitfalls like tool overload and cultural resistance. Join us for actionable takeaways and a Q&A to build a resilient and modern AppSec pipeline.\n\nSpecial thanks to the Rule4 Team for hosting and sponsoring, we couldn't do these events without our sponsors.

Having worked across government, defense, and commercial sectors, Jason brings a unique perspective on the evolving threat landscape and how organizations can stay ahead of it. At Bugcrowd, he helps security teams harness the power of crowdsourced security to identify and remediate risk at scale. With a background rooted in operational security and a deep appreciation for the hacker mindset, Jason is passionate about helping organizations adopt modern, proactive approaches to cybersecurity that are both practical and impactful.\n\n**Abstract**:\nAs threats evolve faster than ever, traditional security models struggle to keep pace. Enter crowdsourced security\u2014a model that taps into the global hacker community to uncover vulnerabilities before adversaries do. In this session, we\u2019ll explore how Bugcrowd is helping organizations\u2014from startups to the federal government\u2014scale their security programs through managed bug bounty, vulnerability disclosure, and penetration testing. We\u2019ll walk through real-world lessons learned, common pitfalls, and how aligning with frameworks like OWASP Top 10 enhances outcomes. Whether you\u2019re an AppSec professional, pentester, or just curious about the power of ethical hacking at scale, this session will provide insights you can take back to your own environment.\n\n**Location**:\nGuidePoint Security\n3030 N Rocky Point Dr W\nSTE 600\nTampa, FL 33607\n\n**Sponsors**:\nBugcrowd - [https://www.bugcrowd.com/](https://www.bugcrowd.com/)"
