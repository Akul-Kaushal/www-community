If you are thinking \"Wait, what does that have to do with application security, Bill?\" the answer is ... everything.\n\nThis talk outlines several challenges inherent to the biomanufacturing industry, such as the poorly understood and highly dynamic nature of biomanufacturing processes. Instruments critical to assessing quality and safety are described as among the least defensible apparatus humanity has ever built, leaving the sector exposed to adversarial threats. Despite recent progress in bioengineering, the explainability of these manufacturing processes is still built on fragile foundations.\n\nTo address these issues, Peter suggests moving away from flawed traditional methods of assessment and adopting physics-based probabilistic models, which offer better assurance and explainability. he emphasizes the importance of formal methods to ensure reliability and manage risks without completely rebuilding the system. Additionally, he advocates for accepting manageable risks and enhancing manufacturing trust through practical, science-based solutions."

Instead of a speaker, we're offering a hands-on Capture-the-Flag event. Not the \"stay up all night finding this one weird trick\" kind of CTF, but a CTF designed to teach you to exploit real world vulnerabilities in a real-world application. Entry level participants can explore a poorly designed authorization system and mid-level hackers will have plenty of opportunities to run SQL and JavaScript Injection attacks. For the experts, there is even a pathway to shell, but it will take some real dedication to get there.\n\nThe focus will be solidly on learning. A walkthrough guide will be available to get you to the next step no matter where you get stuck, and live demos of each exploit will be given before the evening is through. Even if you're not quite sure what Cross-site Scripting really is, by the end of the night you can have your first exploit under your belt. We'll also be encouraging experienced participants to team up with those who are new to web exploitation.\n\nBRING YOUR OWN LAPTOP with an intercepting proxy (Burp, ZAP, etc.) installed to participate as an attacker. Of course, if you\u2019re not comfortable at that level, feel free to just bring yourself and plan to shadow, watch, and learn.\n\nInstallation instructions for ZAP can be found here:\n\n[https://www.meristeminfosec.com/resources/guided-ctf](https://www.meristeminfosec.com/resources/guided-ctf)\n\nIf you have questions on how to prepare for the event, a Q&A session will be held on the Monday before the event at 7pm: [https://meet.google.com/dfz-kksa-qzx](https://meet.google.com/dfz-kksa-qzx)\n\nAGENDA\n6:00 - 6:30 Setup, Food, Drinks, Networking\n6:30 - 7:30ish CTF Time\n7:30 - 8:00 More Networking"

The challenge isn\u2019t just securing AI-generated code and systems\u2014it\u2019s evolving your AppSec program to keep pace with software development.\n\nWe'll explore how security teams can evolve their programs across two key dimensions: securing AI-driven software development and using AI to enhance security workflows. You\u2019ll learn:\n\n* Strategies for managing risks from AI-generated code and autonomous agents\n* How security teams can use AI to reduce work and improve security outcomes\n* Where AI can enhance security\u2014and where human expertise remains irreplaceable.\n\nAI isn\u2019t just a security challenge; it\u2019s a chance to build a smarter, more efficient security program. Join us to learn how to make AI work for security, not against it."

The EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA) and landmark legal decisions against Apple\u2019s app store practices are ushering in a new era of mobile security transparency and accountability. At the same time, reports like *Dark Reading\u2019s \u201cMobile Applications Are a Cesspool of Security Issues\u201d* expose the urgent need for serious mobile app and API protection strategies.\nThis talk uncovers the hidden risks of platform monocultures and challenges Apple and Google\u2019s claim that built-in security is sufficient. It offers a practical roadmap for implementing app attestation, runtime protection, and secure API communication to counteract threats such as API scraping, bot automation, credential abuse, and tampered client applications.\nWe'll dissect recent changes in regulation and litigation and explain why OWASP professionals must lead the charge in adopting more resilient, open, and developer-driven mobile security practices.\nLearning Objectives:\n\n* Understand the regulatory and legal catalysts reshaping mobile app security.\n* Learn how API attacks exploit mobile app weaknesses, despite \u201cbuilt-in\u201d platform defenses.\n* Evaluate tools and frameworks, including app attestation and RASP, that enable secure API communication.\n* Gain insights into how to implement dynamic secrets, certificate pinning, and secure client validation.\n* Explore why monopolistic behaviors hinder innovation and what OWASP chapters can do about it.\n\n**Thanks to our SPONSOR**: *[Approov](https://approov.io/)*\n*Regain Control of Your Mobile App Security.*\n*Approov is a team of passionate developers dedicated to making the future of mobile secure. With focus on developing the world\u2019s most complete end-to-end solution for mobile app security from the device into the cloud, our solutions are used worldwide to secure mobile apps and their APIs in everything from automotive, financial services, healthcare to e-commerce, gaming and media.*\n\n**Thanks to our HOST**: *[Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/us-en)*\n*Every day, we embrace change and create value for all our stakeholders around the world.*\n\n*Vendors interested in sponsoring please send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

Thank you to those that attended.\n\nIn our last meetup, attendees voted for [Royal Stacks Bourke Street](https://www.royalstacks.com.au/) as our location for next month. On 2nd July 2025 6PM, there we shall meet.\n\n*There's NO BOOKING. If you're the first to arrive, please grab a table for the group and post a picture of the table's location in the comments of this meetup event. We'll use it to locate each other. (If you don't see a post, you're lucky first. Please grab us a table and post a pic. )*\n\n**Please remember to update your RSVP if you can no longer attend.** Even if it's just 30 minutes prior. It'll help whomever that arrives first know how big a table to get. We will take note of no-shows, and to make sure we've got space for those that do actually attend, your RSVP may be deprioritised for future events.\n\n**If you're having trouble finding us**, send a message to [Dan on Signal](https://signal.me/#eu/4yti0PmJCFvXhLH_vmLcxO7Xy3VAM_yY9wRhOQCA1qn7UqWh1nFBa4rNCccfHyhW).\n\nSee you there.\n\nMore details on the format, and what to expect below:\n\n**The Practitioner's Roundtable**\nIt's a monthly meetup, for AppSec/ProdSec practitioners to participate discussing AppSec/ProdSec topics and share knowledge. There's no speakers, or sponsors; just a facilitator, with the expectation that you'll join the conversations. Broadly, the idea is that you're swinging by after work, for a regular catch-up with our peers over dinner (with F&B at your own cost) with a known format.\n\\-\\-\\-\n**So, what's happening?**\nThe format:\n\n1. At 6pm all attendees arrive, and order (and pay for) their own meals - we'll do the rest while waiting for the meals to arrive and as we eat.\n2. All attendees write down on a card 1-2 AppSec/ProdSec related topics they'd like to discuss.\n3. We'll all each cast 3 votes on the cards we'd like to discuss.\n4. We'll sort the cards, and discuss the topics with the top 3-4 highest votes. Starting with the topic with the highest votes.\n5. After 5(?) minutes, we all decide if we'd like to continue or move on to the next topic.\n6. If we continue, after 15(?) minutes, we all move on to the next topic of discussion.\n7. At 7pm, we wrap up and officially end. Before everyone leaves, we vote on the next restaurant that we'll meet at.\n\nThis is[ inspired by Lean Coffee](https://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/), and intended for participants to be collaborators in the conversation focused on AppSec & ProdSec topics. *You are expected to participate in the AppSec/ProdSec conversations constructively if you attend*. This isn't the place for BizDev focused conversations.\n\nFor the location selection, here are the considerations we work with:\n\n1. It must be within 1 \"city block\" of the Melbourne Free Tram Zone.\n2. The typical price for a whole meal (without alcohol) should be under $50 per person.\n3. It must allow individual orders - you'd be ordering and paying for your own meal.\n4. It will need to have seating space for the group to say, just walk-in to the restaurant ( this may change if it grows beyond 10 regular attendees ).\n5. It must be quiet enough for us to have meaningful conversations.\n6. It must not be a restaurant we've been to in the past 6 months. (Just to keep things fresh )\n\nAlso, although we use the word \u201crestaurant\u201d this is used broadly to mean food establishment - if we\u2019re all keen on hitting up a decent kebab place, that works. As a courtesy to the venue, there's an expectation that you'd order something there."

Explore the tangible impact of AI-generated code in this session by playing with fire. Using ChatGPT-driven prompts, we'll build a fully functional application, and in real time we'll uncover how common security flaws like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and weak authentication can manifest in AI-generated code.\n\nThrough hands-on exploration, we'll walk through the potential impact of these vulnerabilities and how these risks could be avoided with secure coding practices, defined policies, developer guardrails, and thorough security audits and code review.\n\nBy the end of the session, you'll have a deep understanding of how to:\n\n* Recognize and assess the risks AI introduces in your code.\n* Implement secure coding practices and enforce security policies.\n* Integrate security audits, code reviews, and testing into your development workflow to ensure AI-generated code is safe for production.\n\nThis session is vendor agnostic and designed to empower you to reap the benefits of AI without sacrificing security.\n\nApproximate agenda:\n5:30 - Doors open; socializing/connecting, food, OWASP announcements\n6:00 - Presentation\n\nPlease remember to register and keep your registration up to date so we know how many to expect."

In this talk, I\u2019ll take you on a journey from life as an external cybersecurity consultant\u2014armed with test cases, idealistic frameworks, risk rated issues and a 1337-page PDF\u2014to leading an internal security team responsible for actually making it all work in the real world.\nWe\u2019ll explore the shift from writing findings to feeling their friction: why business context is everything, how not all recommendations age well in live environments, and the surprises (good and bad) that come with being embedded in the heartbeat of an organization. Expect real stories, tactical insights, and maybe a few laughs about the irony of once saying \u201cjust implement zero trust\u201d without knowing what the backend chaos actually looked like.\n\nSpeaker: Derek Yu\nTitle: Coding for Compliance Without Losing Your Mind: Real-world CRA and RED DA Lessons\nAbstract:\nWith the EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and RED Delegated Act (RED DA), best practices in security development have become legal obligations. In this talk, I'll share hands-on experiences helping teams implement security by design, security updates, SBOMs, vulnerability handling, supplier management, and more in real-world products. We\u2019ll cover common developer pitfalls and how to align DevSecOps activities with standards like EN 18031 and future norms. Expect practical takeaways, tooling tips, and insights from the field. If you're building connected products, this will help your team save time and stay ahead of the curve."

This talk dives into the secret life of malicious packages: what they are, where they lurk, how they operate, and the many creative ways they can wreak havoc. From innocent-seeming typosquats to the compromise of trusted, widely-used packages, we\u2019ll explore the full spectrum of threats and real-world examples that show just how sneaky (and dangerous) these packages can be.\n\nSo how can we protect ourselves from these threats? There are various options such as checking package health, source code reviews/scans, or use of tooling such as SCA tools. SCA scans, while very useful for vulnerability scanning, cannot be relied upon to protect against malicious packages. This talk will discuss their blind spots and other options for adding further protection. It will further reinforce that security should always take a multi-layered approach.\n\n**About our speaker**\nI'm an application security engineer who started out as a web developer. Security drew me in with the endless puzzles and challenges put forth by the field. I love sharing knowledge, particularly when I can both educate and horrify my audience at the same time. After all, what can happen when security goes wrong is pretty scary. I also enjoy working closely with software engineering teams to try to make security work within existing development practices, or at least try to minimize how painful \"doing security\" can be. When not behind a computer, I can usually be found making some sort of costume piece or shiny object."

In some cases, AppSec is even positioned as a tax on the business as a necessary cost center; businesses only know it's important because lawsuits, burgeoning regulation, and breach headlines have\ntold them it is. This presents a challenge to get buy-in from stakeholders, which makes our jobs very difficult, sometimes impossible.\n\nHowever, what we do has real, human consequences. We have the opportunity to reframe security practices by focusing on this \u201coutside in\u201d perspective: the perspective of TRUST.\n\n**High-level outline**\nResearch on customer/consumer trust \u2013 what is \u201ctrust\u201d?\n\n*  Boiled down to four factors: capability, reliability, transparency, and humanity\n*  High levels of trust increase revenue\n*  There is a correlation between security, privacy, resilience, risk, compliance, and customer trust\n\nSecurity is not separate work, security is a foundational feature\n\n*  Customers/consumers expect vendors to protect their data\n*  Security is not a cost center \u2013 it\u2019s a revenue enabler (customer trust = customer loyalty = increased revenue)\n\nSecurity practices need to be marketed\n\n*  Human psychology: we want to believe we are special and have a purpose\n*  Communicating the full impact of doing or not doing security practices well\n*  \u201cCustomer trust\u201d as a burgeoning discipline within CISO organizations"
