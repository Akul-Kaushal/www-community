By signing up, you consent to us sharing your name and email with Systematic Software Engineering solely for the purpose of visitor pass registration.\n\n**Agenda:**\n**19:00 \u2013 19:10** Welcome by Systematic Software Engineering and OWASP Aarhus\n\n**19:15 \u2013 19:45** \"A04:2021 \u2013 Insecure Design ved Systematic\" af Michael Ustrup, Software Security Architect, Systematic Software Engineering\n\nOm pr\u00e6sentationen:\nMichael l\u00f8fter sl\u00f8ret for sit hjertebarn og giver et indblik i, hvordan Systematic h\u00e5ndterer A04:2021 \"Insecure Design\".\n\n**19:45 \u2013 20:30** Networking break including tapas and drinks\n\n**20:30 \u2013 21:25** \"How (not) to Engage Developers in AppSec\" by Mads Schaarup Andersen, Lead IT Security Consultant, Cyber Strategy & Security Test, BankData\n\nabout the presentation:\nMany appsec programs struggle to make developers engage with security. This ranges from mitigating pentest and security scanning results to simply following the security policy. This often leads to the conclusion that developers don't care about security. However, developers exist in a context where managers, company policies, customer demands all influence how they prioritize tasks and given the right circumstances, most developers do indeed want to do secure software. In this talk, based on experience, research, and methods from human computer interaction, Mads will present the dos and don'ts of how to engage developers and successfully implement appsec.\n\nabout Mads:\nMads is currently working as a lead application security architect and has worked in security and privacy for more than 15 years. He has previously worked as a security and privacy consultant, worked in academic research, and has experience as a software engineer. His approach to application security and privacy is based on developer enablement and involvement through security champions programs - a mainly bottom-up approach where developers\u2019 main tasks and concerns are taken seriously. Furthermore, Mads\u2019s approach has a strong methodological foundation in human computer interaction with methods such as participatory design, design thinking, interviews, focus groups, workshops, etc."

        "description": "Identity and access management in the cloud remains the most fertile ground for high-value exploitations. So why is it still the least understood part of AWS? For starters, the way RBAC was implemented in the public cloud created a series of unintended consequences (role proliferation, etc) that confound security. Add to that how confusing the interconnecting IAM policy logic tree is. Then consider most are trying to understand \u2018identity\u2019 in the cloud as something akin to human credentials\u2026 when it\u2019s far from that. Add it all together, and you have the beautiful mess we\u2019re trying to manage today.\n\nJeff Moncrief\u2019s been puzzling through the how and why of cloud IAM for the past few years. He found the best way to learn IAM is to just break it. Join Jeff as he deploys his \u2018IAM walker\u2019 script and shows the holes in a typical AWS environment, moves laterally from a typically ec2 exploit, abuses privilege escalation, steals data, and exfiltrates successfully without detection. Along the way, he\u2019ll discuss:\n\n* Why we misunderstand the purpose of IAM in AWS\n* Rethinking IAM responsibilities of devs vs. security without breaking workloads\n* Different control points in AWS, like implementing service-level security and designating \u2018sensitive permissions\u2019"

He regularly gets emails and DMs from people asking him to help them with their security program metrics and given that it's been 10 years since he last presented this, it's time to revisit.\n\nThis talk focuses on metrics for security organizations in general, and AppSec related metrics in specific. In other words, how do security organizations measure their impact, and whether they're doing a \"good job\" or not? What do you measure, how do you measure it, and why does anyone care? Let's dive deep into a boring topic that nobody wants to talk about, but you all know you need to master.\n\n**Speaker:**\nRafal Los"

And yes, there will be **delicious food and drinks** generously provided by our hosts!\n\n5:30 PM : Doors open, Networking, food and drinks\n5.45 PM :- Chapter introductions\n6-6.45 PM :- Proactive Defense: Preventing Account Takeovers Before They Begin\n6.45-7.30 :- Implementing Secure guardrails\n\n**Talk #1 Proactive Defense: Preventing Account Takeovers Before They Begin**\nAccount Takeovers (ATOs) have become the silent enablers of modern breaches\u2014where attackers don\u2019t break in, they log in. Whether sourced from phishing campaigns, infostealer logs, or vast combolists circulating on the dark web, leaked credentials continue to fuel unauthorized access across both enterprise and customer-facing environments.\nThis session will explore practical strategies for preventing ATOs, with a focus on:\n\n* Proactively detecting and remediating leaked credentials across employees and customers.\n* Leveraging phishing visibility to detect early signs of compromise.\n* Introducing AI-driven analysis using the Model Context Protocol (MCP): an experimental approach within Cursor that enhances AI\u2019s ability to search, contextualize, and support on-demand investigation of leaked credentials\n\nAttendees will learn how to integrate these methods to build a strong defense against account takeovers, strengthening security and resilience against cyber threats. By adopting proactive credential defense and tools like MCP, organizations can develop an adaptive response to account takeover threats.\n**Speakers: Barath Subramaniam**, Senior Product Security Engineer at Adobe, has over 16 years of experience. He manages security data exchange programs between security and product teams, focusing on security automation, AI, data engineering, identity monitoring for stolen credentials, brand abuse detection, and phishing.\n\n**Alessio Iacovone** is a Product Security Engineer at Adobe with three years of experience on the Data and AI Engineering team, specializing in applying AI to enhance security efforts.\n\n**Talk#2** Implementing Secure guardrails\nIn the fast-paced world of AI software development, balancing rapid innovation with robust security is a persistent challenge. Security guardrails offer a solution by providing protective boundaries that guide developers towards secure practices without hindering agility.\n\nThis talk delves into a pragmatic methodology for establishing and scaling security guardrails within your organization. Drawing from real-world experiences at leading tech companies, we'll explore:\n\n* Implementing security controls across infrastructure, applications, and dependencies.\n* Identifying areas to implement guardrails.\n* Establishing secure defaults in foundational services\n* Leveraging static code analysis to steer developers towards secure coding patterns.\n* Prioritizing common security issues to standardize best practices.\n* Building a library of quick wins and integrating them into development workflows.\n\nWe'll also discuss the iterative journey of building guardrails, from laying foundational safety nets to developing contextual and strategic controls that align with your organization's evolving security maturity.\n\n**Speaker:** Srajan Gupta, Dave, Senior Security Engineer. An avid threat modeling practitioner and advocate of secure design practices"

If you are thinking \"Wait, what does that have to do with application security, Bill?\" the answer is ... everything.\n\nThis talk outlines several challenges inherent to the biomanufacturing industry, such as the poorly understood and highly dynamic nature of biomanufacturing processes. Instruments critical to assessing quality and safety are described as among the least defensible apparatus humanity has ever built, leaving the sector exposed to adversarial threats. Despite recent progress in bioengineering, the explainability of these manufacturing processes is still built on fragile foundations.\n\nTo address these issues, Peter suggests moving away from flawed traditional methods of assessment and adopting physics-based probabilistic models, which offer better assurance and explainability. he emphasizes the importance of formal methods to ensure reliability and manage risks without completely rebuilding the system. Additionally, he advocates for accepting manageable risks and enhancing manufacturing trust through practical, science-based solutions."

The challenge isn\u2019t just securing AI-generated code and systems\u2014it\u2019s evolving your AppSec program to keep pace with software development.\n\nWe'll explore how security teams can evolve their programs across two key dimensions: securing AI-driven software development and using AI to enhance security workflows. You\u2019ll learn:\n\n* Strategies for managing risks from AI-generated code and autonomous agents\n* How security teams can use AI to reduce work and improve security outcomes\n* Where AI can enhance security\u2014and where human expertise remains irreplaceable.\n\nAI isn\u2019t just a security challenge; it\u2019s a chance to build a smarter, more efficient security program.

Drawing from vulnerability research experience at the NSO Group and building Pegasus, the speaker will highlight how overlooked low and medium vulnerabilities can be combined to execute successful attacks. By examining attack chains and application runtime behavior, attendees will see how gaps often missed by traditional methods are exposed. Attendees will learn about effective tools and techniques for detecting and mitigating these threats, especially in cloud-native and distributed systems. Designed for security practitioners and academics, this session provides a deeper understanding of defending against sophisticated attackers by adopting their mindset.\n\n**Thanks to our SPONSOR**: *[Kodem Security](https://www.kodemsecurity.com/)*\n*The AppSec chase is over.*\n*Swap endless alerts with focused action. Simplify the remediation of your most exploitable issues through runtime security.*\n\n**Thanks to our HOST**: *[Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/us-en)*\n*Every day, we embrace change and create value for all our stakeholders around the world.*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

In this talk, I\u2019ll take you on a journey from life as an external cybersecurity consultant\u2014armed with test cases, idealistic frameworks, risk rated issues and a 1337-page PDF\u2014to leading an internal security team responsible for actually making it all work in the real world.\nWe\u2019ll explore the shift from writing findings to feeling their friction: why business context is everything, how not all recommendations age well in live environments, and the surprises (good and bad) that come with being embedded in the heartbeat of an organization. Expect real stories, tactical insights, and maybe a few laughs about the irony of once saying \u201cjust implement zero trust\u201d without knowing what the backend chaos actually looked like.\n\nSpeaker: Derek Yu\nTitle: Coding for Compliance Without Losing Your Mind: Real-world CRA and RED DA Lessons\nAbstract:\nWith the EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and RED Delegated Act (RED DA), best practices in security development have become legal obligations. In this talk, I'll share hands-on experiences helping teams implement security by design, security updates, SBOMs, vulnerability handling, supplier management, and more in real-world products. We\u2019ll cover common developer pitfalls and how to align DevSecOps activities with standards like EN 18031 and future norms. Expect practical takeaways, tooling tips, and insights from the field. If you're building connected products, this will help your team save time and stay ahead of the curve."

In some cases, AppSec is even positioned as a tax on the business as a necessary cost center; businesses only know it's important because lawsuits, burgeoning regulation, and breach headlines have\ntold them it is. This presents a challenge to get buy-in from stakeholders, which makes our jobs very difficult, sometimes impossible.\n\nHowever, what we do has real, human consequences. We have the opportunity to reframe security practices by focusing on this \u201coutside in\u201d perspective: the perspective of TRUST.\n\n**High-level outline**\nResearch on customer/consumer trust \u2013 what is \u201ctrust\u201d?\n\n*  Boiled down to four factors: capability, reliability, transparency, and humanity\n*  High levels of trust increase revenue\n*  There is a correlation between security, privacy, resilience, risk, compliance, and customer trust\n\nSecurity is not separate work, security is a foundational feature\n\n*  Customers/consumers expect vendors to protect their data\n*  Security is not a cost center \u2013 it\u2019s a revenue enabler (customer trust = customer loyalty = increased revenue)\n\nSecurity practices need to be marketed\n\n*  Human psychology: we want to believe we are special and have a purpose\n*  Communicating the full impact of doing or not doing security practices well\n*  \u201cCustomer trust\u201d as a burgeoning discipline within CISO organizations"
