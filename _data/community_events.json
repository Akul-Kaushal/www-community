High-profile breaches, such as 3CX's compromised CI/CD pipeline\u2014where the North Korean Lazarus Group injected malicious code into widely used apps\u2014the JetBrains TeamCity exploit, where Russian state-sponsored actors gained unauthorized admin control without user interaction, and Sisense's exposure of critical credentials through unsecured GitLab repositories, highlight alarming vulnerabilities in development workflows.\nWe'll explore how these threat actors exploit flaws in CI/CD processes. Drawing on CloudNative's experience, we'll provide strategies to strengthen your DevOps pipeline without sacrificing agility.\u201d\n\n**19:55 \u2013 20:10** \\- Network break with coffee\\, tea\\, water and snacks\\.\n\n**20:10 \u2013 20:55** \\- \"Bring diversity and inclusion to tech\" by Lise Lystlund\n\n\"The tech community excels at knowledge sharing and supporting one another. Without hesitation, people from across the globe dedicate time to help others solve coding problems. To me, this reflects a welcoming and collaborative community that anyone would want to be a part of. Tech is also an appealing field, offering numerous workplace benefits and opportunities for growth. Yet, despite these advantages, the industry continues to struggle with attracting women. How is it that a group representing 50% of the population remains so underrepresented in tech\u2014and, more importantly, what can we do to change this?\"\n\n**20:55 \u2013 21:00** \\- Closing Remarks by OWASP Aarhus and Cloud Native"

However, in Application Security (AppSec), it hasn\u2019t fully reached its potential\u2014yet.\nThis talk will explore why the next big breakthrough in AI is poised to revolutionize threat modeling and security reviews, areas traditionally plagued by manual processes, high complexity, and slow adoption in fast-moving development environments.\nWe are at the tipping point where AI can understand code deeply enough to automate threat modeling, shifting it left and removing bottlenecks in the security review process. By using AI to derive data flows, identify threats and controls, and continuously update threat models, we can potentially integrate security into the development lifecycle more effectively.\nJoin this session to discuss and discover how AI could potentially take threat modeling as code (and from code!) to the next level.\n\n\"**Proactive Risk Detection at the Design Stage\" - Ella Bor**\n\nSecurity risks can be costly when discovered late in development, and the \u201cshift left\u201d movement seeks to address this. This talk explores strategies for identifying potential risks during the design phase, even before coding begins. By analyzing ticketing systems with AI, development teams can identify potential risks such as insecure data handling or problematic third party integrations early on\u2014without slowing development velocity. The discussion will highlight methods to uncover design-phase risks while using AI to propose security review questions and automatically generate threat stories on a large scale. This approach not only simplifies the design review process but also helps prevent the creation of insecure code.\n\n**Guest Talk - Speaker TBC**\n\n**RAFFLE - win a prize kindly donated by our sponsors!**\n\n**SPEAKERS:**\n\n**Petra Vukmirovi\u0107 (**[@PetraVuk1311](http://twitter.com/PetraVuk1311))\n\nTechnology enthusiast, leader, public speaker, believer in radical candor, ex-emergency medicine doctor, competitive athlete (volleyball) and ex-sports scholar. Petra started her cyber security career as a security engineer, climbed up the ladder to Director of Cyber Security. Love creating order out of chaos, learning and overcoming any challenges that come along my way. Always leveraging innovation and looking to implement improvements in processes and systems.\n\n**Ella Bor**\n\nElla Bor is an experienced data scientist, honed her skills across diverse industry domains, including legal-tech, e-commerce, and application security. At Apiiro, she harnesses her extensive expertise to drive innovation in application security. Ella specializes in leveraging artificial intelligence to tackle real-world challenges, developing and implementing end-to-end algorithmic solutions that automate complex tasks. Throughout her career, Ella has been dedicated to bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical application, ensuring that AI-driven solutions are both technically sound and aligned with business goals.\n\n**TICKETS:**\n\nOWASP meetups are free and open to anyone interested in application security. Please note that you MUST book your place to be admitted to the event by the building security.\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT:**\n\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

        "description": "G'day all,\n\nIt was great to see new faces last month. Thank you to those that attended.\n\nIn our last meetup, attendees voted for [YOI Indonesian Fusion](https://yoirestaurant.com.au/) as our location for next month. On 30th October 2024 6PM, there we shall meet.\n\n*There's NO BOOKING. If you're the first to arrive, please grab a table for the group and post a picture of the table's location in the comments of this meetup event. We'll use it to locate each other. (If you don't see a post, you're lucky first. Please grab us a table and post a pic. )*\n\n**Please remember to update your RSVP if you can no longer attend.** Even if it's just 30 minutes prior. It'll help whomever that arrives first know how big a table to get.\n\nWe're looking forward to the discussions we had once again.\n\nSee you there.\n\nMore details on the format, and what to expect below:\n\n**The Practitioner's Roundtable**\nIt's a monthly meetup, for AppSec/ProdSec practitioners to participate discussing AppSec/ProdSec topics and share knowledge. There's no speakers, or sponsors; just a facilitator, with the expectation that you'll join the conversations. Broadly, the idea is that you're swinging by after work, for a regular catch-up with our peers over dinner (with F&B at your own cost) with a known format.\n\\-\\-\\-\n**So, what's happening?**\nThe format:\n\n1. At 6pm all attendees arrive, and order (and pay for) their own meals - we'll do the rest while waiting for the meals to arrive and as we eat.\n2. All attendees write down on a card 1-2 AppSec/ProdSec related topics they'd like to discuss.\n3. We'll all each cast 3 votes on the cards we'd like to discuss.\n4. We'll sort the cards, and discuss the topics with the top 3-4 highest votes. Starting with the topic with the highest votes.\n5. After 5(?) minutes, we all decide if we'd like to continue or move on to the next topic.\n6. If we continue, after 15(?) minutes, we all move on to the next topic of discussion.\n7. At 7pm, we wrap up and officially end. Before everyone leaves, we vote on the next restaurant that we'll meet at.\n\nThis is[ inspired by Lean Coffee](https://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/), and intended for participants to be collaborators in the conversation focused on AppSec & ProdSec topics. You are expected to participate in the AppSec/ProdSec conversations constructively if you attend. This isn't the right place for BizDev focused conversations.\n\nFor the location selection, here are the considerations we work with:\n\n1. It must be within 1 \"city block\" of the Melbourne Free Tram Zone.\n2. The typical price for a whole meal (without alcohol) should be under $50 per person.\n3. It must allow individual orders - you'd be ordering and paying for your own meal.\n4. It will need to have seating space for the group to say, just walk-in to the restaurant ( this may change if it grows beyond 10 regular attendees ).\n5. It must be quiet enough for us to have meaningful conversations.\n6. It must not be a restaurant we've been to in the past 6 months. (Just to keep things fresh )\n\nAlso, although we use the word \u201crestaurant\u201d this is used broadly to mean food establishment - if we\u2019re all keen on hitting up a decent kebab place, that works. As a courtesy to the venue, there's an expectation that you'd order something there."

Cyberattacks are increasingly successful, targeting sensitive patient data, disrupting critical services, and putting lives at risk. Facing a growing threat landscape due to increasing reliance on interconnected technologies (including IoT, IoMT, OT and IT systems), many hospitals are struggling to recover from decades of accumulated cybersecurity debt.\n\nThis presentation will explore the root causes of healthcare cyberattacks, providing real-world examples and discussing the technical vulnerabilities that make organizations prime targets. Attendees will gain insights into the emerging guidance and strategies for improving healthcare cybersecurity, as well as the debate surrounding the need for regulation in this critical sector. We will also examine the significant financial and reputational costs associated with cyberattacks and delve into the motivations and tactics of the attackers themselves.\n\nJoin OWASP Nashville and Chad Holmes as we dive deep into the world of healthcare cybersecurity.

I will try to explain key quantum concepts like superposition and entanglement, contrasting them with classical computing principles.\n\nI will address security concerns by discussing the vulnerability of current cryptographic algorithms and infrastructure to quantum attacks. A brief history of cryptography and solutions to the challenges from quantum computing. Then we will outline ongoing efforts to develop quantum-resistant cryptography and the standardization processes from organizations such as NIST.\n\nOpportunities for adoption of post-quantum computing safe algorithms exist today and can be planned for and budgeted. Education and awareness will be crucial, ensuring stakeholders understand the implications of quantum computing on cybersecurity.\n\nBy the end of the presentation, attendees will gain a foundational understanding of quantum computing's impact on security and practical steps to protect sensitive data in a quantum-enabled future.\n\nWe're always looking for presenters and topics for future meetings - contact John (john.dileo@owasp.org) if you have an idea for a topic, or a presentation you'd like to make. That way, it won't always be John talking about what he's been working on recently.\n\nThe Auckland-area OWASP Meetup usually takes place on the third Tuesdays of March, May, July, September, and November.

While a lot time is spent on evaluating prompt injection, there is an entire ecosystem of applications that allow models to be run and used. These applications have their own important security considerations that you may not be aware of.\nInference Servers are used to host machine learning models and expose APIs that allow other components to perform inference on those models. These servers often expose additional APIs that allow users to load new models. Often, this can be abused to perform remote code execution. While this technology is new, the baseline security configurations for many of these products are a relic from the past.\nIn this talk we\u2019ll learn about what an inference server is, how they work, and how you can achieve remote code execution in them. This talk is mainly focused on the practical security risks involved in this ecosystem. Finally, I will share details about a couple of CVEs related to TorchServe\n\n**Presenters:**\n\nPratik Amin has been an Application Security practitioner for over 15 years. He currently works as a Principal Security Consultant at Kroll (previously Security Compass Advisory). In this role, he spends most of his time performing AppSec pentests and digging into interesting technology."
