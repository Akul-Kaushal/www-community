        "description": "**Overview:**\nOperational technology (OT) perimeters are rapidly emerging as a new frontier for attackers, mirroring the adversarial challenges seen in traditional IT boundaries. This talk explores crucial vulnerability classes and real-world exploitation tacticsaffecting common OT perimeter technologies. We will highlight significant risks and potential impacts of perimeter compromise on industrial environments. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the emerging threats at the OT boundary and the exploitation techniques adversaries may leverage.\n\n**Abstract:**\nAttacking IACS: Strategic Industrial Exploitation Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) underpin critical infrastructure worldwide but often rely on outdated security paradigms, which may leave them vulnerable to modern attacks. This presentation explores technical attack methodologies targeting IACS, contrasting them with traditional enterprise network exploitation techniques. Drawing on extensive experience in vulnerability research, exploit development, and red teaming, I will highlight the unique challenges and attacker opportunities presented by IACS environments\u2014such as reliance on legacy technologies, proprietary protocols, and stringent operational constraints.\n\nStructured around the IEC/TR 62443-3-1 standard, this presentation addresses critical gaps in modern security guidance for IACS environments. I will use examples to demonstrate strategic attack opportunities and illustrate how vulnerabilities are exploited differently within industrial settings compared to enterprise environments. Attendees will gain technical insights into the challenges of securing IACS against sophisticated attacks and leave with actionable defense strategies that address current IACS security gaps."

Great AppSec is really hard.\nOver almost 2 decades, Peter Chestna has consulted on and observed hundreds of AppSec programs. He's even built a few of my own. The similarities are striking and the impact and outcomes in these programs are stymied by common misconceptions about the goal of AppSec and the results we should be seeking.\n\nIn general, we find too much, fix too little, and do almost nothing to prevent new vulnerabilities. We have built a world where we attempt to report and goal our way to victory. How's that working for us? We need to rebalance our efforts across these three pillars and put the emphasis where it belongs. The accumulation of security debt is burying us all under a mountain of exception processing and annual recertification. Stop the madness!\n\nWhether you are a security leader or a development leader, Peter has practical guidance for you. In this presentation, Peter hopes to convince you that by shifting your current focus, you can drastically improve the results you get from your efforts.\n\nIn this talk, Peter will describe how to:\n1\\. Turn developers from adversaries to allies\\.\n2\\. Modify your controls to reflect reality and make compliance feel better\n3\\. Put the effort of your finite resources to places that will have the greatest impact\n4\\. Elevate your AppSec program to a level of excellence through effective developer engagement\n\n**Dinner Sponsorship: Brooksource**\n\n**Parking Information:** See picture below for parking and entrance information.\n\n**Evening Agenda:**\n5:30 \u2013 6:00 pm > Networking and Food (**in-person only**)\n6:00 \u2013 6:15 pm > Central Indiana ISSA Introduction and Chapter Business\n6:15 \u2013 7:30 pm > Meeting Speaker(s)\n7:30 \u2013 8:00 pm > Brooksource Social (Rooftop Bar) / Cleanup\n\n**Please note that the location for our chapter meetings is at Brooksource located at 6215 College Avenue, Indianapolis, IN 46220.**\n\n**PLEASE ARRIVE as close to 6:00 pm. as you can**\n\n![](https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F988552403%2F53386386960%2F1%2Foriginal.20250320-145032?h=740&w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&q=75&sharp=10&s=f5f6e341efbde307a59f5189215f5551)"

        "description": "G'day all,\n\nHappy new year! We're back into the swing of things. We found the \"Lean Coffee-style\" format worked well in 2024, so we're back with it once again as a place for AppSec practitioners to share their knowledge. We're looking forward to the AppSec discussions we had once again.\n\nWe're starting the year again at [YOI Indonesian Fusion](https://yoirestaurant.com.au/) as our location for April. On Wed, 2nd April 2025 6PM, there we shall meet. We aim to meet the 1st Wednesday every month from April to October.\n\n*There's NO BOOKING. If you're the first to arrive, please grab a table for the group and post a picture of the table's location in the comments of this meetup event. We'll use it to locate each other. (If you don't see a post, you're lucky first. Please grab us a table and post a pic. )*\n\n**Please remember to update your RSVP if you can no longer attend.** Even if it's just 30 minutes prior. It'll help whomever that arrives first know how big a table to get. We will take note of no-shows, and to make sure we've got space for those that do actually attend, your RSVP may be deprioritised for future events.\n\nSee you there.\n\nMore details on the format, and what to expect below:\n\n**The Practitioner's Roundtable**\nIt's a monthly meetup, for AppSec/ProdSec practitioners to participate discussing AppSec/ProdSec topics and share knowledge. There's no speakers, or sponsors; just a facilitator, with the expectation that you'll join the conversations. Broadly, the idea is that you're swinging by after work, for a regular catch-up with our peers over dinner (with F&B at your own cost) with a known format.\n\\-\\-\\-\n**So, what's happening?**\nThe format:\n\n1. At 6pm all attendees arrive, and order (and pay for) their own meals - we'll do the rest while waiting for the meals to arrive and as we eat.\n2. All attendees write down on a card 1-2 AppSec/ProdSec related topics they'd like to discuss.\n3. We'll all each cast 3 votes on the cards we'd like to discuss.\n4. We'll sort the cards, and discuss the topics with the top 3-4 highest votes. Starting with the topic with the highest votes.\n5. After 5(?) minutes, we all decide if we'd like to continue or move on to the next topic.\n6. If we continue, after 15(?) minutes, we all move on to the next topic of discussion.\n7. At 7pm, we wrap up and officially end. Before everyone leaves, we vote on the next restaurant that we'll meet at.\n\nThis is[ inspired by Lean Coffee](https://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/), and intended for participants to be collaborators in the conversation focused on AppSec & ProdSec topics. *You are expected to participate in the AppSec/ProdSec conversations constructively if you attend*. This isn't the place for BizDev focused conversations.\n\nFor the location selection, here are the considerations we work with:\n\n1. It must be within 1 \"city block\" of the Melbourne Free Tram Zone.\n2. The typical price for a whole meal (without alcohol) should be under $50 per person.\n3. It must allow individual orders - you'd be ordering and paying for your own meal.\n4. It will need to have seating space for the group to say, just walk-in to the restaurant ( this may change if it grows beyond 10 regular attendees ).\n5. It must be quiet enough for us to have meaningful conversations.\n6. It must not be a restaurant we've been to in the past 6 months. (Just to keep things fresh )\n\nAlso, although we use the word \u201crestaurant\u201d this is used broadly to mean food establishment - if we\u2019re all keen on hitting up a decent kebab place, that works. As a courtesy to the venue, there's an expectation that you'd order something there."

Don't miss out\u2014RSVP now and spread the word!\n\nAgenda:\n\n1. **When cryptography let us down - or maybe we let the cryptography down?**\n*[Iwona Polak (IGNIS)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iwona-polak/)*\nCryptography is meant to serve and protect us, but sometimes it brings us to tears. During the presentation, I will show how we can hurt ourselves with cryptography. There'll be a little bit of math, and a lot of demos.\n2. After the break, we will be hosting a **discussion about cryptography in use**. Any examples of real-world cryptography failures? What are the challenges in reliably implementing cryptographic security? What are the most common cryptography programming errors that lead to security breaches? Is there a risk that legal regulations may hinder the implementation of modern cryptographic solutions? How to train development teams on the proper use of cryptography? Why people still roll their own cryptography in production environments, after decades of saying not to do that?\n\n**Please RSVP and save the date!**\n***Use this  [sign-up link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdvj6iOdA_dD5tO9sYfRgD2Ko1jKaUiPSUndh4Fxr-YgFXOpg/viewform)  to streamline your walk-in to the Zendesk office and secure your spot at this inspiring event.***\n\nIf you have a minute, **please share this invitation** with friends and in your social media.\n\n**Who is our host?**\n**[Zendesk](https://www.linkedin.com/company/zendesk/)** is a global tech company that creates customer service software and products help more than 145,000 global brands (AirBnb, Uber, JetBrains, Slack, among others) making their customers happy, every day.\n\nThe Polish hub with main office in Krakow is one of Zendesk's key European centers with software developers and security specialists, with 300+ members and continuing to grow.\n\n* Headquarters: SF\n* Global offices: 15\n* Employees: 5,700+\n* Customers: 145K+d"

However, limitations such as \u201challucinations\u201d in which the model generates inaccurate or misleading outputs highlight the importance of human oversight in managing [risk posed by AI.](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nowsecure.com/blog/2024/11/13/the-ai-expansion-of-the-mobile-app-attack-surface-2/__;!!CiF3mHgEawk!GssNkv5CwozvfTaxygbQLi1ioHIc19CE3CvGKAs_O0ele9J9xXF2cotd_ExIbn2DT0uSktJ44pJhX1KU8Mtiq6eRnRAODGYNig$ \"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2024/11/13/the-ai-expansion-of-the-mobile-app-attack-surface-2/__;!!CiF3mHgEawk!GssNkv5CwozvfTaxygbQLi1ioHIc19CE3CvGKAs_O0ele9J9xXF2cotd_ExIbn2DT0uSktJ44pJhX1KU8Mtiq6eRnRAODGYNig$\")\nThis talk covers a novel approach for recovering application source code, leveraging AI language models to transform pseudo-disassembly into high-level source code. This method is able to handle complex abstractions introduced in high-level languages SwiftUI or Dart and generates output in popular programming languages like Swift, C#, Kotlin, Java, Python or even Bash.\n\n***II.* AI coding agents -Risks and Benefits-Endor Lab**\nThe proliferation of AI coding agents will accelerate the production of code, but what are the risks associated with this acceleration? In many ways the core challenge to securing these outputs will be the familiar fundamental challenges that appsec has always faced: maintaining an understanding of your inventory and risk-posture, conducting security assessments at scale, and managing processes for risk acceptance and remediation. Good appsec fundamentals will be critical in the new era of AI generated code. But coding agents also introduce novel concerns born from the inherent differences between these agents and human developers, as well the additional layers of abstraction which will become intrinsic to AI development: understanding how to vet and validate non-human agents, identifying the operational risks posed by agents trained on open-source, and the complexity of managing code developed through natural language will all require the development of new practices in appsec. This talk will look at some of the new risks that will arise in the era of large scale AI code development, and discuss possible paths forward for deploying such agents in a secure way.\n\n***III.*** **AppSec for AI AND NHI -GrayLog**\nAPPSEC FOR AI AND NHI - As we're empowering NHIs (**Non Human Identity**) to take on greater responsibilities, it's smart to wonder how we'll keep these good bots in bounds. This isn't possible to answer without acknowledging a dirty little secret -- while modern software is already driven by bots, modern security tools fall short in observing and regulating interactions between bots and APIs, whether those bots are trusted NHIs or malicious attackers. This session dispels a few myths about bots and bot detection and shows a few practical considerations and techniques to identify and block high-risk activities.\n\n***IV.*** **The Shadow AI and AppSec: What You Don\u2019t Know Will Get You!-ByteWhisper**\nThe over-the-top headlines about artificial intelligence (AI) have only been outstripped by the breakneck speed by which many are adopting AI to transform their organizations. Shadow AI creates significant security exposures, like development teams processing sensitive customer data through unauthorized AI tools for creating mission-critical solutions using unvetted open-source AI models. This session will focus on where Shadow AI and appsec intersect \u2013 the coding co-pilots, the platforms, and the risks that they represent to your organization. This session will provide an overview of Shadow AI, how application development might unknowingly create Shadow AI, and tools to identify and mitigate Shadow AI."
