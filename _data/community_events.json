By signing up, you consent to us sharing your name and email with Systematic Software Engineering solely for the purpose of visitor pass registration.\n\n**Agenda:**\n**19:00 \u2013 19:10** Welcome by Systematic Software Engineering and OWASP Aarhus\n\n**19:15 \u2013 19:45** \"A04:2021 \u2013 Insecure Design ved Systematic\" af Michael Ustrup, Software Security Architect, Systematic Software Engineering\n\nOm pr\u00e6sentationen:\nMichael l\u00f8fter sl\u00f8ret for sit hjertebarn og giver et indblik i, hvordan Systematic h\u00e5ndterer A04:2021 \"Insecure Design\".\n\n**19:45 \u2013 20:30** Networking break including tapas and drinks\n\n**20:30 \u2013 21:25** \"How (not) to Engage Developers in AppSec\" by Mads Schaarup Andersen, Lead IT Security Consultant, Cyber Strategy & Security Test, BankData\n\nabout the presentation:\nMany appsec programs struggle to make developers engage with security. This ranges from mitigating pentest and security scanning results to simply following the security policy. This often leads to the conclusion that developers don't care about security. However, developers exist in a context where managers, company policies, customer demands all influence how they prioritize tasks and given the right circumstances, most developers do indeed want to do secure software. In this talk, based on experience, research, and methods from human computer interaction, Mads will present the dos and don'ts of how to engage developers and successfully implement appsec.\n\nabout Mads:\nMads is currently working as a lead application security architect and has worked in security and privacy for more than 15 years. He has previously worked as a security and privacy consultant, worked in academic research, and has experience as a software engineer. His approach to application security and privacy is based on developer enablement and involvement through security champions programs - a mainly bottom-up approach where developers\u2019 main tasks and concerns are taken seriously. Furthermore, Mads\u2019s approach has a strong methodological foundation in human computer interaction with methods such as participatory design, design thinking, interviews, focus groups, workshops, etc."

        "description": "Identity and access management in the cloud remains the most fertile ground for high-value exploitations. So why is it still the least understood part of AWS? For starters, the way RBAC was implemented in the public cloud created a series of unintended consequences (role proliferation, etc) that confound security. Add to that how confusing the interconnecting IAM policy logic tree is. Then consider most are trying to understand \u2018identity\u2019 in the cloud as something akin to human credentials\u2026 when it\u2019s far from that. Add it all together, and you have the beautiful mess we\u2019re trying to manage today.\n\nJeff Moncrief\u2019s been puzzling through the how and why of cloud IAM for the past few years. He found the best way to learn IAM is to just break it. Join Jeff as he deploys his \u2018IAM walker\u2019 script and shows the holes in a typical AWS environment, moves laterally from a typically ec2 exploit, abuses privilege escalation, steals data, and exfiltrates successfully without detection. Along the way, he\u2019ll discuss:\n\n* Why we misunderstand the purpose of IAM in AWS\n* Rethinking IAM responsibilities of devs vs. security without breaking workloads\n* Different control points in AWS, like implementing service-level security and designating \u2018sensitive permissions\u2019"

He regularly gets emails and DMs from people asking him to help them with their security program metrics and given that it's been 10 years since he last presented this, it's time to revisit.\n\nThis talk focuses on metrics for security organizations in general, and AppSec related metrics in specific. In other words, how do security organizations measure their impact, and whether they're doing a \"good job\" or not? What do you measure, how do you measure it, and why does anyone care? Let's dive deep into a boring topic that nobody wants to talk about, but you all know you need to master.\n\n**Speaker:**\nRafal Los"

And yes, there will be **delicious food and drinks** generously provided by our hosts!\n\n5:30 PM : Doors open, Networking, food and drinks\n5.45 PM :- Chapter introductions\n6-6.45 PM :- Proactive Defense: Preventing Account Takeovers Before They Begin\n6.45-7.30 :- Implementing Secure guardrails\n\n**Talk #1 Proactive Defense: Preventing Account Takeovers Before They Begin**\nAccount Takeovers (ATOs) have become the silent enablers of modern breaches\u2014where attackers don\u2019t break in, they log in. Whether sourced from phishing campaigns, infostealer logs, or vast combolists circulating on the dark web, leaked credentials continue to fuel unauthorized access across both enterprise and customer-facing environments.\nThis session will explore practical strategies for preventing ATOs, with a focus on:\n\n* Proactively detecting and remediating leaked credentials across employees and customers.\n* Leveraging phishing visibility to detect early signs of compromise.\n* Introducing AI-driven analysis using the Model Context Protocol (MCP): an experimental approach within Cursor that enhances AI\u2019s ability to search, contextualize, and support on-demand investigation of leaked credentials\n\nAttendees will learn how to integrate these methods to build a strong defense against account takeovers, strengthening security and resilience against cyber threats. By adopting proactive credential defense and tools like MCP, organizations can develop an adaptive response to account takeover threats.\n**Speakers: Barath Subramaniam**, Senior Product Security Engineer at Adobe, has over 16 years of experience. He manages security data exchange programs between security and product teams, focusing on security automation, AI, data engineering, identity monitoring for stolen credentials, brand abuse detection, and phishing.\n\n**Alessio Iacovone** is a Product Security Engineer at Adobe with three years of experience on the Data and AI Engineering team, specializing in applying AI to enhance security efforts.\n\n**Talk#2** Implementing Secure guardrails\nSpeaker: Srajan Gupta, Dave, Senior Security Engineer.

        "description": "**This event is kindly hosted by Civo Tech Junction and sponsored by Endor Labs . There is limited seating available for in-person attendees. Registration required.**\n**This event will be live-streamed on YouTube.**\n**Recordings will be available on the OWASP London YouTube channel.**\n\n**Venue Location**: Civo Tech Junction, First Floor, 32-37 Cowper Street, London, EC2A 4AW\n**Nearest Tube:** Old Street (Northern Line), Cowper Street exit - 1 min walk\n**Doors Open at 6pm** for registration, pizza, drinks and networking. The talks start at 6:30pm (we start on time!).\n\n**TALKS:**\n\n**OWASP Introduction, Welcome and News** \\- Sam Stepanyan\\, Andra Lezza\\, Sherif Mansour \\- OWASP London Chapter Leaders\n\n\"**Attacks on Open Source Supply Chains: How Hackers Poison the Well**\" - **Henrik Plate**\n\nThe ubiquitous use of open source during software development makes it an interesting and valuable target for software supply chain attacks, where\nattackers inject malicious code in upstream open source projects such that it is executed by software developers or end users down the line. This talk provides an overview about common attack vectors, illustrated by real-world examples, and sheds some light on countermeasures.\n\n**\"Introducing the OWASP SocialOSINTLM Project\" - Brenden Miller**\n\n**SocialOSINTLM** is a powerful Python-based tool designed for Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering and analysis. It aggregates and analyzes user activity across multiple social media platforms, including Twitter / X, Reddit, Hacker News (via Algolia), Mastodon and Bluesky. Leveraging AI through the OpenRouter API, it provides comprehensive insights into user engagement, content themes, behavioral patterns, and media content analysis.\n\n**\"Using LLMs To Accelerate Threat Detection\" - Richard Finlay Tweed**\n\nInventing good detections is hard, using them with your SIEM (Security information and event management system) is even harder. That's where Large Language Models (LLMs) come in. This talk will describe how to use your existing runbooks, and experience, to improve your threat detection coverage\n\n**RAFFLE - win a prize kindly donated by our sponsors!**\n\n**SPEAKERS**\n\n**Henrik Plate**\n\nHenrik Plate is the principal security researcher at Endor Labs. He formerly worked for SAP Security Research, where he established and led the focus topic \u201cOpen Source Security\u201d starting 2014. He co-authored academic papers on this topic, presented at academic and industry conferences like the RSA, and started several open source projects in this space. He earned his PhD in 2024 from the University of Rennes, France, with a thesis titled \u201cOn the Security Risks of Open Source Consumption\u201d, and holds a CISSP certification\n\n**Brenden Miller**\n\nBrenden Miller is a Cyber Security Consultant at Accenture UK & Ireland. He brings over 20 years of technical experience working internationally, evolving through roles in systems administration, SRE, and cloud engineering. His interest in data and AI applications led to the creation of SocialOSINTLM, a tool applying AI and NLP to social media open-source intelligence.\n\n**Richard Finlay Tweed**\n\nRichard Tweed is a Kubernetes specialist at Tessl. Over the last five years he has been ensuring security, scalability and compliance across all major Kubernetes cloud platforms.

Drawing from vulnerability research experience at the NSO Group and building Pegasus, the speaker will highlight how overlooked low and medium vulnerabilities can be combined to execute successful attacks. By examining attack chains and application runtime behavior, attendees will see how gaps often missed by traditional methods are exposed. Attendees will learn about effective tools and techniques for detecting and mitigating these threats, especially in cloud-native and distributed systems. Designed for security practitioners and academics, this session provides a deeper understanding of defending against sophisticated attackers by adopting their mindset.\n\n**Thanks to our SPONSOR**: *[Kodem Security](https://www.kodemsecurity.com/)*\n*The AppSec chase is over.*\n*Swap endless alerts with focused action.

As development accelerates\u2014with AI-driven tooling, microservices, and cloud-native architectures\u2014the ratio of code to developer is exploding. But the ratio of AppSec engineers to developers isn\u2019t keeping pace, leaving security teams overwhelmed and reactive.\n\nIt\u2019s time to flip the model: instead of starting with findings, we must start with the application. Vulnerabilities are just one signal\u2014without deep application context, they're noise. Real-time application modeling enables teams to understand how applications actually behave in production: what code is reachable, which services talk to each other, what data is exposed, and where trust boundaries are violated.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll demonstrate how runtime-aware application modeling can surface critical risks that traditional approaches miss, eliminate false positives, and bridge the gap between AppSec and engineering. We'll walk through real-world examples of how modeling helps prioritize what truly matters\u2014and why this shift is essential for scaling security in modern software development."

This lunch and learn will bring topics that influence discussion among your peers and provide a venue to meet others that share your passions.\n\n**Agenda**:\n\n* 11:15am - Registration and Lunch\n* 12:00pm - Speaker - Kent Wilson - Crowdsourced Security in Practice: Lessons from the Frontlines\n* 1:15pm - Depart\n\n**Speaker**:\nKent Wilson is Vice President of Global Public Sector at Bugcrowd, where he leads efforts to bring crowdsourced security to government agencies and critical infrastructure worldwide. With over 20 years in cybersecurity as both a practitioner and executive leader, Kent has helped organizations of all sizes\u2014from federal agencies to private-sector innovators\u2014strengthen their security through vulnerability disclosure, bug bounty, and offensive security testing. He\u2019s passionate about the power of ethical hacking and often speaks on topics like public-private collaboration, AI security, and how to build security programs that keep pace with today\u2019s threats. Before Bugcrowd, Kent held leadership roles at several top cybersecurity firms and served in the U.S. Army.\n\n**Abstract**:\nAs threats evolve faster than ever, traditional security models struggle to keep pace. Enter crowdsourced security\u2014a model that taps into the global hacker community to uncover vulnerabilities before adversaries do. In this session, we\u2019ll explore how Bugcrowd is helping organizations\u2014from startups to the federal government\u2014scale their security programs through managed bug bounty, vulnerability disclosure, and penetration testing. We\u2019ll walk through real-world lessons learned, common pitfalls, and how aligning with frameworks like OWASP Top 10 enhances outcomes. Whether you\u2019re an AppSec professional, pentester, or just curious about the power of ethical hacking at scale, this session will provide insights you can take back to your own environment.\n\n**Location**:\nGuidePoint Security\n3030 N Rocky Point Dr W\nSTE 600\nTampa, FL 33607\n\n**Sponsors**:\nBugcrowd - [https://www.bugcrowd.com/](https://www.bugcrowd.com/)"

        "description": "Four teammates walked into a bar\u2014a developer, an AppSec engineer, a SecOps lead, and a compliance officer. It sounds like the start of a terrible joke, but no one was laughing. They were too busy drowning in alerts, blaming each other, and wondering if their security program had secretly been designed by their worst enemies. Sound painfully familiar?\n\nIn this talk, I'll share the surprisingly entertaining story of how these burned-out heroes discovered The Three Ways of Effective AppSec. Using the metaphor of a modern city (complete with bank robberies, construction projects, and government bureaucracy), they unlocked the power of context, collaboration, and culture\u2014transforming a chaotic security circus into a highly cost-effective (and even enjoyable) program that keeps their software safe from vulnerabilities and attacks.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever felt trapped in AppSec Groundhog Day, facing endless firefighting, alert fatigue, and compliance busywork, come laugh (and maybe cry) your way toward a practical blueprint for building an AppSec program that actually works."
